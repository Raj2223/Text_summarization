This is why most summarization systems used today happen to be Extractive.

There are two broad approaches when it comes to generating automatic summaries, namely: extractive and abstractive. In this article, we will go over the basics of TextSummarization, the different approaches, and some of the real world applications. We will also compare various Text Summarisation models with the help of ROUGE, a set of metrics used to evaluate automatic Text Summaries, in Python. The goal of this article is to show how different models can be used to create different types of summaries in different situations. The end goal is to help people understand how to use TextSummaries in their daily lives and to improve their knowledge of how to make the best use of the technology they are using to create short summaries. We hope that this article will help you understand how TextSumming can help you make better use of your time.\n"
