Come November 3, the country will decide whether Donald Trump would continue in office or will Joe Biden take over. The US politics is dominated by two parties -- The Republican Party and the Democrats. The candidates will compete to win electoral college votes. And remember, this is the first major election in between a health pandemic, so things are different this time around. The results may also take longer than before.\\xa0The US\\xa0Presidential election, the most-keenly watched, is set to be held on November 3.\\xa0To become president, either candidate needs to win a majority of 538 electors, i.e. 270 electors. All 50 US states and Washington DC have a specific number of \"electors\" in the electoral college, roughly proportionate to the size of each state. Each state gets at least three electoral votes. Washington DC too gets three electorate college votes, which means a total of 538 electors form the Electoral College. With 55 electoral votes, California is the largest state, followed by Texas with 38. New York and Florida have 29 each. Only two states - Maine and Nebraska - use a winner-takes-all system. If you win the most votes in a state, you take its entire share of electoral college votes.\\xa0DONALD TRUMP - The Republican nominee\"Make America Great Again\" - This is what Donald Trump, the current president of the US, is banking on with his eyes set on retaining his coveted chair as a Republican nominee for a second term. Trump is the 45th President of the United States. In November 2016, Trump was elected President in the largest electorate college landslide for a Republican in 28 years, defeating the Democratic nominee, former US\\xa0senator and secretary of state Hillary Clinton, in the general election. He won more than 2,600 counties nationwide, the most since President Ronald Reagan in 1984. At age 70, Trump became the oldest presidential candidate ever to be newly elected.Image Source : FILEDonald TrumpDonald TrumpJOE BIDEN- The Democratic nomineeHaving served in public life for around a half-century, Joe Biden is now up against Donald Trump in the race for US presidency. Biden, a Democratic nominee, was a United States senator for 36 years and vice president for eight. Biden had run for presidentship twice before becoming vice president under President Barack Obama. In a ceremony at the White House, President Obama had awarded Joe Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction\\x97the nation\\x92s highest civilian honor.Image Source : APJoe BidenJoe BidenMIKE PENCE - The Republican nomineeMike Pence, the Republican nominee for vice president, has spent 12 years in the United States House of Representatives and four years as governor of Indiana when presidential candidate Donald Trump picked him as his running mate in 2016. Pence had launched a successful bid for his local Congressional seat in 2000, entering the United States House of Representatives at the age of 40. After serving in Congress for 12 years, Mike Pence was elected the 50th Governor of Indiana in 2012. Indiana\\'s success story, Pence\\'s record of legislative and executive experience is believed to have prompted Trump to select him as his running mate. His wife, Karen Pence, is believed to be his closest adviser.\\xa0Image Source : APMike PenceMike PenceKAMALA HARRIS - The Democratic nomineeKamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for vice president, has many firsts -- first female and first Black elected attorney general in California; first South Asian American to serve in the United States Senate; and first Asian American or Black woman nominated for vice president. Harris grew up with her Indian heritage. Her parents were immigrants - mother from India and father from Jamaica, came to the United States for their further education. She is serving a six-year term representing California in the Senate. However, she might have to give up the seat two years early if the Democrats win in November and she becomes vice president.Image Source : APKamala HarrisKamala HarrisThe task of counting the votes usually begins late on the election day, which is November 3. The result process is expected to take several days.\\xa0Most mail-ballots should be received within a couple of days of November 3. Though there are some exceptions. Some key states including Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Minnesota, Nevada and Ohio allow ballots to be sent in late. States will begin to certify results from November 10, however, there could be a delay in case of a recount. Barring California, every state must complete the certification by December 8.On January 20, 2021, the US will welcome its new President.\\xa0The President-elect and the Vice President-elect will take the oath of office, which will be followed by an inaugural address.

Tens of thousands of Afghans have fled or have been evacuated, including large numbers of the educated elites. They either fear for their economic future or lack of freedom under a group that ascribes to a strict interpretation of Islam and during its previous rule in the late 1990s barred girls from school and women from work.Tuesday marks six months since the Afghan capital of Kabul was ceded to the Taliban with the sudden and secret departure of the country\\'s US-backed president. The takeover of Kabul had been preceded by a months-long Taliban military campaign to take control of provincial areas, many of which fell with hardly a fight.Image Source : APA Taliban fighter passes in front of a street vendor who sells red heart-shaped balloons for Valentine\\'s Day in KabulA Taliban fighter passes in front of a street vendor who sells red heart-shaped balloons for Valentine\\'s Day in KabulToday, the sight of armed Taliban fighters roaming the street still jars and frightens residents. But women have returned to the streets, and many young men have put on Western clothes again after initially shedding them for the traditional shalwar kameez, the long shirt and baggy pants favoured by the Taliban.Unlike in the 1990s, the Taliban are allowing some women to work. Women are back in their jobs in the health and education ministries, as well as at Kabul International airport, often next to men. But women are still waiting to return to work in other ministries. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the economic downward spiral, and women have been hit hardest.The Taliban have cracked down on women\\'s protests and harassed journalists, including briefly detaining two foreign journalists working with the UN refugee agency last week.Image Source : APAfghan stand in a park in front of Taliban fighters near Kabul, AfghanistanAfghan stand in a park in front of Taliban fighters near Kabul, AfghanistanOn Monday, the detention of some young men selling heart-shaped flowers in recognition of Valentine\\'s Day was a stark reminder that the new all-male religion-driven administration has no tolerance for Western ideas of romance.Girls in grades 1-6 have been going to school, but those in the higher grades are still locked out in most parts of the country.\\xa0 The Taliban promised all girls will be in school after the Afghan new year at the end of March. Universities are gradually reopening and private universities and schools never closed.Poverty is deepening. Even those who have money have a hard time accessing it. At banks, lines are long as residents wait for hours, sometimes even days, to withdraw a limit of $200 a week.More than USD 9 billion in Afghanistan\\'s foreign assets were frozen after the Taliban takeover. Last week, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that promised USD 3.5 billion \\x97 out of USD 7 billion of Afghanistan\\'s assets frozen in the United States \\x97 would be given to families of America\\'s 9/11 victims. The other USD 3.5 billion would be freed for Afghan aid.Afghans across the political spectrum have decried the order, accusing the US of taking money that belongs to Afghans.\\xa0The Taliban have campaigned for international recognition of their all-male, all-Taliban government, but they are being pressed to create an inclusive administration and guarantee the rights of women and religious minorities.Image Source : APAfghans lineup outside the Iranian embassy, to apply for avisa, in Kabul, Afghanistan.Afghans lineup outside the Iranian embassy, to apply for avisa, in Kabul, Afghanistan.Graeme Smith, a senior consultant for the International Crisis Group\\'s Asia Program, warned against using sanctions, saying that would backfire.\"Keeping economic pressure on the Taliban will not get rid of their regime, but a collapsing economy could lead to more people fleeing the country, sparking another migration crisis,\" he said.He also noted that this round of Taliban rule \\x93probably ranks as the most peaceful six-month period that Afghanistan has enjoyed in four decades.\\x94The Taliban have re-opened the country\\'s passport office, which is clogged with thousands of people a day. The Taliban have promised Afghans they can travel but only with proper documents. Those trying to leave seem largely driven by fear of a failing economy or the desire for greater freedom in a more liberal society.Several officials linked to the former US-backed government have returned. One of the returnees, former ambassador Omar Zakhilwal, said he encountered no rancor from the Taliban.He said he hoped that the Taliban will \\x93find the courage\\x94 to open their ranks, guarantee minorities a say in the government and go further to guarantee rights of all Afghans.\\xa0Also Read |\\xa07 killed, 9 injured in minivan bomb blast, Taliban officials sayAlso Read |\\xa0Taliban ban display of female mannequin heads in shops; music in cars, taxis', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

They noted among other things that Chinese officials are still reluctant to share some raw data, citing concerns over patient confidentiality.Earlier this year, WHO sent a team of experts to Wuhan, where the first human COVID-19 cases were detected in December 2019, to probe what might have triggered the pandemic now blamed for nearly 4.5 million deaths worldwide, with more than 10,000 people a day succumbing despite more than 5 billion doses of vaccine administered.In their analysis, published in March, the WHO team concluded the virus probably jumped to humans from animals, and they described the possibility of a laboratory leak as \\x93extremely unlikely.\\x94But the WHO experts said their report was intended only as a first step and added, \\x93The window of opportunity for conducting this crucial inquiry is closing fast: any delay will render some of the studies biologically impossible.\\x94For example, they said, \\x93Antibodies wane, so collecting further samples and testing people who might have been exposed before December 2019 will yield diminishing returns.\\x94China said Wednesday that officials should \\x93concentrate on other possible avenues that may help trace the origin\\x94 of COVID-19 and suggested studies should be pursued in other countries.Fu Cong, a director-general in China\\x92s Foreign Ministry, agreed it was a \\x93pity\\x94 the search for COVID-19\\x92s origins had stalled but said it wasn\\x92t China\\x92s fault. \\x93China has always supported and will continue to participate in the science-based origin tracing efforts,\\x94 he said.He accused the U.S. of \\x93hyping the lab leak theory\\x94 and trying to shift the blame onto China, and implied the coronavirus might be linked to high-level American research labs, suggesting the United States invite WHO to investigate some of its installations.Marion Koopmans and her WHO-recruited colleagues listed a number of priorities for further research, including conducting wider antibody surveys that might identify places where COVID-19 was spreading undetected, both in China and beyond, testing wild bats and farm-raised animals as potential reservoirs of the virus, and investigating any credible new leads.Some other scientists fear the best opportunities to collect samples might have been missed during the first few weeks after some of the earliest human cases appeared linked to a Wuhan seafood market.Chinese researchers collected hundreds of environmental samples immediately after the coronavirus was found, but it is unclear how many people or animals were tested.\\x93Once you have wildlife traders shifting over to other kinds of employment because they\\x92re worried about whether they\\x92ll be able to do this anymore, that window starts to close,\\x94 said Maciej Boni, a Pennsylvania State University biology professor who has studied virus origins and was not part of the WHO team.Still, Boni said scientists might be able to pinpoint COVID-19\\x92s animal source by hunting for closely related viruses in species like raccoon dogs, mink or ground squirrels. But he said it could take about five years to do the kind of extensive studies necessary.The search for COVID-19\\x92s origins has become a bitter source of dispute between the U.S. and China, with increasing numbers of American experts calling for the two Wuhan laboratories close to the seafood market to be investigated, something China has flatly rejected and branded \\x93scapegoating.\\x94Biden in May ordered a 90-day review by U.S. intelligence agencies of both the animal-to-human hypothesis and the lab-leak theory.

He targeted Trump\\x92s environmental record, calling for a review of all regulations and executive actions that are deemed damaging to the environment or public health, aides said Tuesday as they previewed the moves.Another order instructs federal agencies to prioritize racial equity and review policies that reinforce systemic racism. Biden also revoked a Trump order that sought to exclude people in the U.S. illegally from the numbers used for apportioning congressional seats among the states and ordered federal employees to take an ethics pledge that commits them to upholding the independence of the Justice Department.The president also revoked the just-issued report of Trump\\x92s \\x931776 Commission\\x94 that promotes \\x93patriotic education.\\x94READ MORE:\\xa0\\'Will repair our alliances, engage with the world once again\\': Biden in fiery inauguration speechThose moves and others will be followed by dozens more in the next 10 days, the president\\x92s aides said, as Biden looks to redirect the country without having to go through a Senate that Democrats control by the narrowest margin and will soon turn to the impeachment trial of Trump, who is charged by the House of inciting the insurrection at the Capitol.Republicans signaled that Biden will face fierce opposition on some parts of his agenda.One of his orders seeks to fortify the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA, a signature effort of the Obama administration that provided hundreds of thousands of young immigrants protection from deportation and a pathway to citizenship. That\\x92s part of a broader immigration plan Biden sent to Congress on Wednesday that would provide an eight-year path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. without legal status.The plan would lead to \\x93a permanent cycle of illegal immigration and amnesty that would hurt hard-working Americans and the millions of legal immigrants working their way through the legal immigration process,\\x94 said Chris Hartline, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.Even that familiar criticism seemed a return to the normalcy Biden has promised after years of disruptive and overheated politics. Hewing to tradition,Biden started his day by attending church with both Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress.

But the government achieved a narrow victory.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",
      "[\"NASA's tribute to APJ Abdul Kalam: New species named after late Indian President\", 'Scientists at NASA have named a new organism discovered by them after late Indian President Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam.', 'Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam, a renowned scientist and former president, is a revered figure in India whose name is taken with utmost respect. Many roads and educational institutions have been named after the People\\'s President in a tribute to his service to the nation.\\xa0But his popularity is not limited to national boundaries. NASA, the premier space agency of the world, has also recognised his contribution to science and has paid a tribute to much-loved Dr. Kalam.\\xa0Scientists at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have named a new organism discovered by them after the late Indian President.\\xa0Till date, the new organism -- a form of a bacteria -- has been found only on the International Space Station (ISS) and has not been found on earth!\\xa0Researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the foremost lab of NASA for work on inter-planetary travel, discovered the new bacteria on the filters of the International Space Station (ISS) and named it Solibacillus kalamii to honour the late president, who was a renowned aerospace scientist.\\xa0Kalam had his early training at NASA in 1963 before he set up India\\'s first rocket-launching facility in the fishing village of Thumba in Kerala.\\xa0\"The name of the bacterium is Solibacillus kalamii, the species name is after Dr Abdul Kalam and genus name is Solibacillus which is a spore forming bacteria,\" said DrKasthuri Venkateswaran, senior research scientist, Biotechnology and Planetary Protection Group at JPL.The filter on which the new bug was found remained on board the ISS for 40 months. Called a high-efficiency particulate arrestance filter or HEPA filter, this part is the routine housekeeping and cleaning system on board the international space station.\\xa0This filter was later analysed at JPL and only this year did Venkateswaran publish his discovery in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology.\\xa0According to Venkateswaran, even as it orbits the earth some 400 kilometres above, the ISS is home to many types of bacteria and fungi which co-inhabit the station with the astronauts who live and work on the station.\\xa0Venkateswaran said even though Solibacillus kalamii has never been found on earth till date, it is really not an extra-terrestrial life form or ET.\\xa0\"I am reasonably sure it has hitch hiked to the space station on board some cargo and then survived the hostile conditions of space,\" explained Venkateswaran.\\xa0Naming the new microbe after Kalam was natural to Venkateswaran and his team.\\xa0\"Being a fellow Tamilian, I am aware of the huge contributions by Dr. Kalam,\" he said.\\xa0New bacteria are usually named after famous scientists. Venkateswaran is part of a team which is asking that eternal question \"are we alone in the universe?\"\\xa0Towards that, his responsibilities include monitoring the bug levels on the ISS and he also has to ensure that all spacecraft that fly to other planets are free of terrestrial bugs.\\xa0One of his big jobs was to ensure that NASA\\'s Mars Curiosity rover -- the massive car-sized almost 1000 kg buggy -- was totally sterile when it left earth.\\xa0By international law, this extreme hygiene is required else other planets could get contaminated by bugs that reach the Martian or other planets hidden on human satellites.\\xa0Today the ISS is the size of a football field and its construction started with a launch in 1998 and as of now it is the largest human-made object orbiting the earth.\\xa0Weighing about 419 tonnes, it can house a maximum of six astronauts and has costs roughly USD 150 billion.\\xa0Till date, 227 astronauts have flown to the space station. This makes the space station actually a very dirty place and maintaining hygiene is critical so that humans can live on it with ease.\\xa0On the space station all the air and water is recycled, being a completely closed environment there is a rapid build- up of moulds and bacteria on the station.\\xa0These not only have to be cleaned but monitored to ensure that they do not corrode the walls of the space station and do not turn hazardous to the astronauts.\\xa0Venkateswaran\\'s main job is to monitor the environment of the space station so that harmful bugs do not proliferate.\\xa0He heads the \\'Microbial Observatory\\' on the ISS projects to measure microorganisms associated with compartments owned by the US.\\xa0 According to NASA, he also directs several research and development tasks for the JPL - Mars Program Office, which enables the cleaning, sterilisation, and validation of spacecraft components.\\xa0He directs several NASA competitive awards on the microbial monitoring of spacecraft and associated environments for the Exploration System Mission Directorate, closed habitats like ISS or its earth analogues for the Human Exploration and Operation Mission Directorate.\\xa0But is the new bug of some use.\\xa0\"These spore formers tend to withstand high radiation and also produce some useful compounds protein wise which will be helpful for biotechnology applications,\" Venkateswaran said.\\xa0His team has not characterised the bacteria fully but he hints that the new bug could be a key source for chemicals that can help protect against radiation damage.(With PTI inputs)', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

(Photo/AP)In an extraordinary embrace of a longtime US enemy, President Donald Trump on Monday openly questioned his own intelligence agencies\\' firm finding that Russia meddled in the 2016 US election to his benefit, seeming to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s insistence that Moscow\\'s hands were clean.The reaction back home was immediate and visceral, among fellow Republicans as well as usual Trump critics. \"Shameful,\" \\'\\'disgraceful,\" \\'\\'weak,\" were a few of the comments. Makes the US \"look like a pushover,\" said GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee.Related Stories Donald Trump\\x92s comment on Brexit left people confused if it\\x92s funny or sad. Watch videoHelsinki summit: Trump says he sees no reason why Russia would interfere in 2016 US Presidential electionTrump-Putin Summit: Russian President says he did not interfere in 2016 US Presidential electionsTrump\\'s meeting with Putin in Helsinki was his first time sharing the international stage with a man he has described as an important US competitor \\x97 but whom he has also praised a strong, effective leader.His remarks, siding with a foe on foreign soil over his own government, was a stark illustration of Trump\\'s willingness to upend decades of US foreign policy and rattle Western allies in service of his political concerns. A wary and robust stance toward Russia has been a bedrock of his party\\'s world view. But Trump made clear he feels that any firm acknowledgement of Russia\\'s involvement would undermine the legitimacy of his election.Standing alongside Putin, Trump steered clear of any confrontation with the Russian, going so far as to question American intelligence and last week\\'s federal indictments that accused 12 Russians of hacking into Democratic email accounts to hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016.Image Source : AP Russian President Vladimir Putin gives a soccer ball to US President Donald Trump, left, during a press conference after their meeting at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland on July 16, 2018.

I will say this: I don\\'t see any reason why it would be,\" Trump said.His skepticism drew a quick formal statement \\x97 almost a rebuttal \\x97 from Trump\\'s director of national Intelligence, Dan Coats.\"We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy, and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security,\" Coats said.Fellow GOP politicians have generally stuck with Trump during a year and a half of turmoil, but he was assailed as seldom before as he returned home Monday night from what he had hoped would by a proud summit with Putin.Sen. John McCain of Arizona was most outspoken, declaring that Trump made a \"conscious choice to defend a tyrant\" and achieved \"one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, who rarely criticizes Trump, stressed there was \"no question\" that Russia had interfered.Even staunch Trump backer Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, called Trump\\'s comments \"the most serious mistake of his presidency\" and said they \"must be corrected_-immediately.\"Former CIA Director John Brennan, who served under President Barack Obama, called Trump\\'s words \"nothing short of treasonous.\" Brennan tweeted: \"Not only were Trump\\'s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you???\"In a Fox News Channel interview after the summit, Putin pronounced the meetings \"the beginning of the path\" back from the West\\'s past efforts to isolate Russia. \"I think you see for yourself that these efforts failed, and they were never bound to succeed,\" he said.As he flew home to Washington aboard Air Force One, Trump tried to clarify his position via tweet, saying: \"As I said today and many times before, \\'I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.\\' However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past - as the world\\'s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along!\"In their totality, Trump\\'s remarks amounted to an unprecedented embrace of a man who for years has been isolated by the US and Western allies for actions in Ukraine, Syria and beyond. And it came at the end of an extraordinary trip to Europe in which Trump had already berated allies, questioned the value of the NATO alliance and demeaned leaders including Germany\\'s Angela Merkel and Britain\\'s Theresa May.The two leaders\\' long-awaited summit began with a private face-to-face sitdown \\x97 just the leaders and their interpreters \\x97 that lasted more than two hours, before additional meetings joined by senior aides.The pair had held lengthy talks before \\x97 on the sidelines of world leader meetings in Germany and Vietnam last year \\x97 but this was their first official summit and was being watched closely, especially following the announcement Friday of new indictments against 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking Democratic emails to help Trump\\'s campaign.Asked about the indictments, Putin suggested that Moscow and Washington could jointly conduct the investigation, inviting special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigators to come to Russia to interview the 12 people\\x97 an idea Trump hailed as an \"incredible offer.\"Putin said he\\'d expect the US to return the favor and cooperate in the Russian probe against William Browder, a British investor charged with financial crimes in Russia. Browder, an outspoken Putin critic, was a driving force behind a US law targeting Russian officials over human rights abuses.The summit began just hours after Trump blamed the United States \\x97 and not Russian election meddling or its annexation of Crimea \\x97 for a low-point in US-Russia relations.\"Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,\" Trump tweeted Monday morning, blaming \"many years of US foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!\"The Russian foreign ministry responded by liking Trump\\'s tweet and then replying: \"We agree.\"Asked whether Russia was responsible at all, Trump said \"we\\'re all to blame\" for the soured relations.However, \"that changed,\" he said, \"as of about four hours ago.\"Putin ridiculed as \"sheer nonsense\" allegations that Russian intelligence agencies had collected compromising information on Trump during his visit to Moscow years before the election, saying that he had no idea Trump was even visiting.Still, Putin said he had indeed wanted Trump to win the election \\x97 a revelation that might have made more headlines if not for Trump\\'s performance \\x97 but had taken no action to make it happen.\"Yes, I wanted him to win because he spoke of normalization of Russian-US ties,\" Putin said. \"Isn\\'t it natural to feel sympathy to a person who wanted to develop relations with our country? It\\'s normal.\"At the closing press conference, Putin, riding high after hosting a successful World Cup, unveiled a gift he\\'d brought for Trump: a red and white soccer ball, which he tossed to Trump at the neighboring lectern. Trump passed it over to his wife, and said they\\'d give it to their soccer-loving 12-year-old son, Barron.Out on the streets, the summit attracted a grab-bag of protesters, with abortion-rights activists wearing artificially bulging bellies and Trump masks, anti-fascist protesters bearing signs with expletive-laden insults, and free traders, anti-war Ukrainians and gay rights supporters making their voices hear.Watch: What happened when Trump met\\xa0Putin\\xa0in Helsinki   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if (\\'\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || \\'undefined\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

We need a vaccine to be affordable and available to all - a people\\x92s vaccine,\\x94 he said, adding that this means a quantum leap in funding for the ACT-Accelerator and its COVAX Facility.Guterres stressed that for any vaccine to work, people across the globe need to be willing to take it.\"But with the spread of the virus, we are also seeing a proliferation of misinformation about a future vaccine. This is fuelling vaccine hesitancy and igniting wild conspiracy theories. Mistrust in vaccines is on the rise around the world,\\x94 he said.Guterres noted with concern the alarming reports of large segments of the population in some countries indicating their reluctance or even refusal to take a COVID-19 vaccine. \\x93In the face of this lethal disease, we must do our utmost to halt deadly misinformation,\\x94 he said.The 75th session of the UN General Assembly commenced Tuesday and for the first time in the history of the world organization, world leaders will not be travelling to New York to address the annual high-level session and summits due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The victims, many of whom are elderly, continue to endure significant financial hardship from the defendant\\x92s vast fraud enterprise,\\x94 he said.Pathan operated and supervised the call center and was the \\x91closer\\x92 when speaking to victims. He managed the money couriers who illegally sent millions of stolen and hard-earned funds belonging to the victims back to his call center, Parekh said.\\x93When you consider the sheer number of victims this defendant extorted and the magnitude of their losses, the scale of harm and pain he caused is enormous.\\x93As this case demonstrates, we will continue to work closely with our partners to investigate, apprehend, and prosecute transnational criminal enterprises that steal from vulnerable American victims, and will bring the perpetrators of these scams to justice no matter where they are located,\\x94 he said.Pathan is the fourth of six defendants in this case to be sentenced for their role in the conspiracy. Co-defendants Pradipsinh Parmar, 41, and Sumer Patel, 38, both from Ahmedabad acted as money couriers during the conspiracy, and are scheduled to be sentenced on September 20.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if (\\'\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || \\'undefined\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

Restore and expand. Joe Biden is promising to take the country on a very different path from what it has seen over the past four years under President Donald Trump, on issues ranging from the coronavirus and health care to the environment, education and more. The Democratic presidential nominee is promising to reverse Trump policy moves on things such as withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and weakening protections against environmental pollution.

Here\\x92s what we know about what a Biden presidency might look like. ECONOMY, TAXES AND THE DEBT Biden argues that the economy cannot fully recover until COVID-19 is contained. For the long-term recovery, the former vice president is pitching sweeping federal action to avoid an extended recession and to address long-standing wealth inequality that disproportionately affects nonwhite Americans. He would cover the cost of some of his big ticket environmental and health insurance proposals by rolling back much of the 2017 GOP tax overhaul.

Unlike Trump, he doesn\\x92t believe the leading role in the virus response should belong to state governors, with the federal government in support.Biden endorses generous federal spending to help businesses and individuals, along with state and local governments, deal with the financial cliffs of the pandemic slowdown. He\\x92s promised aggressive use of the Defense Production Act, the wartime law a president can use to direct manufacture of critical supplies. Trump has used that law on such things as ventilator production.Biden promises to elevate the government\\x92s scientists and physicians to communicate a consistent message to the public, and he would have the United States rejoin the World Health Organization.He has promised to use his transition period before taking office to convene meetings with every governor and ask those leaders to impose what would be a nationwide mask mandate because the federal government doesn\\x92t have that power. Biden says he would go around holdouts by securing such rules from county and local officials \\x97 though enforcement of all such orders may be questionable.HEALTH CAREThe health care law known as \\x93Obamacare\\x94 was a hallmark of the Obama administration, and Biden wants to build on that to provide coverage for all. He would create a \\x93Medicare-like public option\\x94 to compete alongside private insurance markets for working-age Americans, while increasing premium subsidies that many people already use. Solid middle-class households would have access to subsidized health insurance.Biden estimates his plan would cost about $750 billion over 10 years. That positions Biden between Trump, who wants to scrap the 2010 health law, and progressives who want a government-run system to replace private insurance altogether. Biden sees his approach as the next step toward universal coverage and one he could get through Congress.The Supreme Court, which now has a solid conservative majority, is scheduled to hear a case challenging the law soon after Tuesday\\x92s election. If Biden wins, he would have to deal with the fallout from that eventual decision.On prescription drugs, Biden supports legislation allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for government programs as well as private payers. He would prohibit drug companies from raising prices faster than inflation for people covered by Medicare and other federal programs. He would also limit the initial prices for \\x93specialty drugs\\x94 to treat serious illnesses, using what other countries pay as a yardstick.Biden would put a limit on annual out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare enrollees, a change that Trump sought but was unable to get through Congress. Also similar to Trump, Biden would allow importation of prescription drugs, subject to safety checks.IMMIGRATIONBiden has called Trump\\x92s actions on immigration an \\x93unrelenting assault\\x94 on American values and says he would \\x93undo the damage\\x94 while continuing to maintain border enforcement.Biden says he would immediately reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which allowed people brought to the U.S. illegally as children to remain as legal residents, and end the restrictions on asylum imposed by Trump.He also said he would end the Trump administration\\x92s \\x93public charge rule,\\x94 which would deny visas or permanent residency to people who use public services such as Medicaid, food stamps or housing vouchers. Biden would support a 100-day freeze on all deportations while his administration studied ways to roll back Trump policies. But Biden would eventually restore an Obama-era policy of prioritizing the removal of immigrants who have come to the U.S. illegally and who have been convicted of crimes or pose a national security threat, as opposed to all immigrants who have come to the country illegally \\x97 Trump\\x92s approach. Biden has said he would halt all funding for construction of new walls along the U.S.-Mexico border.FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITYBiden supports a strategy of fighting extremist militants abroad with U.S. special forces and airstrikes instead of planeloads of U.S. troops. He wants to see the U.S. close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. He has backed some U.S. military interventions, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq that he now says was a mistake, but he leans toward diplomacy and trying to achieve solutions through alliances and global institutions.He is a strong supporter of NATO. He warns that Moscow is chipping away at the foundation of Western democracy by trying to weaken NATO, divide the European Union and undermine the U.S. electoral system. He also alleges that Russia is using Western financial institutions to launder billions of dollars to use to influence politicians.Biden calls for increasing the Navy\\x92s presence in the Asia-Pacific and strengthening alliances with Japan, South Korea, Australia and Indonesia. He joins Trump in wanting to end the wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan, but thinks the U.S. should keep a small force in place to counter terrorism.He says Trump\\x92s decisions to exit bilateral and international treaties such as the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord have led other nations to doubt Washington\\x92s word. Biden wants to invite all democratic nations to a summit to discuss how to fight corruption, thwart authoritarianism and support human rights.Biden, who claims \\x93ironclad\\x94 support for Israel, wants to curb annexation and has backed a two-state solution in the long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. He says he would keep the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem after Trump moved it from Tel Aviv.Biden criticizes Trump\\x92s diplomacy with Kim Jong Un, saying Trump\\x92s one-on-one diplomacy gave legitimacy to the North Korea leader and has not convinced Kim that he should give up his nuclear weapons.ENVIRONMENTBiden is proposing a $2 trillion push to slow global warming by throttling back the burning of fossil fuels, aiming to make the nation\\x92s power plants, vehicles, mass transport systems and buildings more fuel efficient and less dependent on oil, gas and coal.Biden says his administration would ban new permits for oil and gas production on federal lands, although he says he does not support a fracking ban.Biden\\x92s public health and environment platform also calls for reversing the Trump administration\\x92s slowdown of enforcement against polluters, which in several categories has fallen to the lowest point in decades. That would include establishing a climate and environmental justice division within the Justice Department.Biden emphasizes environmental justice, which is about addressing the disproportionate harm to lower-income and minority communities from corporate polluters. Biden says he would support climate lawsuits targeting fossil fuel-related industries.He said he would reverse Trump\\x92s plan to exit the Paris climate accord.EDUCATIONEducation is a family affair for Biden. His wife, Jill, has taught in high school and community college, and she delivered her speech to the Democratic National Convention this year from her old classroom.Biden has proposed tripling the federal Title I program for low-income public schools, with a requirement that schools provide competitive pay and benefits to teachers. He wants to ban federal money for for-profit charter schools and to provide new dollars to public charters only if they show they can serve needy students. He opposes voucher programs, where public money is used to pay for private school education.He has pledged to restore Obama-era policies that were rolled back by the Trump administration, including rules on campus sexual misconduct and a policy that aimed to cut federal money to for-profit colleges that left students with heavy debt and unable to find jobs to pay it back.Biden supports legislation to make two years of community college free and to make public colleges free for families with incomes below $125,000. His proposed student loan overhaul would not require repayment for people who make less than $25,000 a year, and would limit payments to 5% of discretionary income for others.He is proposing a $70 billion increase in funding for historically Black colleges and universities, and other schools that serve underrepresented students.ABORTIONBiden supports abortion rights and has said he would nominate federal judges who would uphold Roe v. Wade.He would rescind Trump\\x92s family planning rule, which has prompted many clinics to leave the federal Title X program that provides birth control and basic medical care for low-income women.In a switch from his previous stance, Biden now says he supports \\x93repeal\\x94 of the Hyde Amendment, opening the way for federal programs such as Medicaid to pay for abortions.SOCIAL SECURITYBiden has a Social Security plan that would expand benefits, raise taxes for upper-income people, and add some years of solvency.He would revamp Social Security\\x92s annual cost-of-living adjustment by linking it to an inflation index that more closely reflects changes in costs for older people, particularly health care. That\\x92s been a priority for advocates. He would also increase minimum benefits for lower-income retirees, addressing financial hardship among the elderly.Biden would raise Social Security taxes by applying the payroll tax to earnings above $400,000 a year. The 12.4% tax, equally distributed among employees and employers, currently only applies to the first $137,700 of a person\\x92s earnings. The tax increase would pay for Biden\\x92s proposed benefit expansions and also extend the life of program\\x92s trust fund by five years, to 2040, according to the nonpartisan Urban Institute.GUNSBiden led efforts as a senator to establish the background check system now in use when people buy guns from a federal licensed dealer. He also helped pass a 10-year ban on a group of semi-automatic guns, or \\x93assault weapons,\\x94 during the Clinton presidency.Biden has promised to seek another ban on the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Owners would have to register existing assault weapons with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He would also support a program to purchase assault weapons.Biden supports legislation restricting the number of firearms an individual may purchase per month to one and would require background checks for all guns sales with limited exceptions, such as gifts between family members.Biden would also support legislation to prohibit all online sales of firearms, ammunition, kits, and gun parts.VETERANSBiden says he would work with Congress to improve health services for women, the military\\x92s fastest-growing subgroup, such as by placing at least one full-time women\\x92s primary care physician at each Department of Veterans Affairs\\x92 medical center.He promises to provide $300 million to better understand the impact of traumatic brain injury and toxic exposures, hire more VA staff to cut down office wait times for vets at risk of suicide to zero as well as continue the efforts of the Obama-Biden administration to stem homelessness.TRADELike Trump, Biden accuses China of violating international trade rules, subsidizing its companies and stealing U.S. intellectual property. But he doesn\\x92t think Trump\\x92s tariffs have worked and wants to join with U.S. allies to form a bulwark against Beijing.Biden has joined a growing bipartisan embrace of \\x93fair trade\\x94 abroad \\x97 a twist on decades of \\x93free trade\\x94 talk as Republican and Democratic administrations alike expanded international trade. Biden wants to juice U.S. manufacturing by directing $400 billion of federal government purchases to domestic companies (part of that for buying pandemic supplies) over a four-year term.He wants $300 billion in new support for U.S. technology firms\\x92 research and development. Biden says the new domestic spending must come before he enters into any new international trade deals.He pledges tough negotiations with China, the world\\x92s other economic superpower, on trade and intellectual property matters. China, like the U.S., is not yet a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the multilateral trade agreement that Biden advocated for when he was vice president. As a senator, Biden voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement that the Trump administration renegotiated. The replacement went into effect on July 1.Also Read:\\xa0Joe Biden on brink of White House as he wins Michigan, Wisconsin; leads Trump 264-214', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

Now if going by Trump\\'s claim, Republicans register a victory in Arizona, then they can afford to lose Nevada where President is trailing Biden with over 12,000\\xa0votes.

His children have chimed into the overall White House meltdown, in terms that generally occupy the wide arc between what\\'s \"legal\" and \"illegal\".Biden leads Trump 253 to 214 in the electoral vote tally. A victory in Pennsylvania means it is game over for Trump, who ran a wild campaign in 2016 and has transformed the White House in the strangest of ways in the last four years.Biden is a sharp contrast to Trump, both in the personal and political realm.The last three days have shown Americans glimpses of that very contrast.Biden spent every day since the election trying to ease tensions and delivering his messages with little outward show of anxiety.\"I ask everyone to stay calm.

      "['\\x91Quit Twitter\\x92: Legal experts to Trump on resurrecting stalled travel ban', 'The courts in January halted Trump\\x92s initial order, which banned travel from seven majority-Muslim countries and indefinitely halted entry to Syrian refugees', 'Memo from legal experts to President Donald Trump on resurrecting his stalled travel ban: Quit Twitter.Trump\\x92s 140-character musings Monday may have undercut his own efforts to persuade the Supreme Court to reinstate his revised travel ban, which Trump called a \\x93watered-down, politically correct\\x94 version of what he\\x92d originally sought. Just as Trump\\x92s Justice Department is arguing the ban doesn\\x92t target Muslims, legal experts said the president seems to be suggesting the opposite.Those who oppose the travel ban said Trump\\x92s Tweetstorm, ironically, helps their case. Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general representing Hawaii in its lawsuit against the ban, said it was as if Trump was his co-counsel.\\x93We don\\x92t need the help but will take it!\\x94 Katyal wrote in his own Twitter post.The courts in January halted Trump\\x92s initial order, which banned travel from seven majority-Muslim countries and indefinitely halted entry to Syrian refugees. Trump begrudgingly scaled back the order by removing Iraq from the list and making the Syria refugee ban only temporary, but that order was blocked by the courts, too.At the heart of the legal wrangling is whether Trump\\x92s proposed ban violates the Constitution by discriminating on the basis of religion. As a candidate, Trump called for a \\x93Muslim ban,\\x94 comments that came back to haunt him as president when the courts determined that even his scaled-down order was \\x93rooted in religious animus and intended to bar Muslims from this country.\\x94Not so, the Justice Department has argued, insisting the temporary ban is based on credible national security concerns unrelated to religion, and his campaign statements should be ignored. But Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor, said Trump was making that argument much less tenable by calling the revised order \\x93politically correct.\\x94\\x93These tweets are basically winking at his supporters to say, obviously, I\\x92m only doing this so that the courts will uphold it,\\x94 Vladeck said. \\x93It makes it harder to argue this is not a Muslim ban, and more importantly, it makes it harder to argue that the president\\x92s statements should be irrelevant.\\x94In a series of early-morning tweets, Trump bashed the Justice Department for its decision to ask the Supreme Court to review the second version of the ban \\x97 which he signed.\\x93The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.,\\x94 Trump said. He urged the Justice Department, which he oversees, to seek a \\x93much tougher version\\x94 of the order.Hoping to shore up the order\\x92s legal underpinnings, both the White House and Trump\\x92s Homeland Security chief have insisted it\\x92s not actually a \\x93travel ban,\\x94 criticizing reporters for mischaracterizing it. But Trump on Monday was having none of it.\\x93People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!\\x94 Trump wrote.He pounded the point home Monday night, tweeting, \\x93That\\x92s right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won\\x92t help us protect our people!\\x94The inconsistency put White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders in a delicate spot Monday afternoon as questions streamed in about why Trump was contradicting his aides. His Twitter missive notwithstanding, Sanders insisted Trump \\x93isn\\x92t concerned with what you call it,\\x94 only with protecting Americans.Sanders said the president had asked the Justice Department to pursue an expedited hearing at the Supreme Court, adding that Trump \\x93wants to go as far and as strong as possible under the Constitution to protect the people of this country.\\x94 Still, she said he\\x92d signed the revised ban \\x93for the purposes of expediency\\x94 and wasn\\x92t considering a third version of the ban.Trump argues the ban is crucial for safeguarding American security, and he has intensified his push for it in the wake of the weekend vehicle and knife attack in London that left seven people dead and dozens injured. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack.The second-guessing about Trump\\x92s Twitter strategy extended to the husband of one Trump\\x92s senior advisers. New York lawyer George T.

It\\x92s unclear whether the president has conveyed his requests to the department in a forum other than Twitter. The Justice Department declined to comment.Trump has used attacks around the world to justify his pursuit of the travel and immigration ban, one of his first acts since taking office. The original order, signed at the end of his first week in office, was hastily unveiled without significant input from top Trump national security advisers or relevant federal agencies.After that order was struck down, the administration decided to write a second directive rather than appeal the initial ban to the Supreme Court. The narrower would temporarily halt entry to the U.S. from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.If anything, Supreme Court may be more likely to hear the case in light of the tweets, to determine once and for all how far the president\\x92s power goes, said Peter S.

      "['Al-Qaeda operates under Taliban protection: UN report', 'The report said that the group has strengthened its positions in and around Kabul, where it conducts most of its attacks, targeting minorities, activists, government employees and personnel of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.', 'Al-Qaeda operates under Taliban protection: UN report (Representational Image)The United Nations has warned in a new report that the threat from terror groups such as Daesh and Al-Qaeda is expanding in many places in Afghanistan. It said the security situation remains fragile with uncertainty surrounding the peace process and a risk of further deterioration.The report by the UN Security Council, published on Thursday, said that despite territorial, leadership, manpower and financial losses during 2020 in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, Daesh\\'s Khorasan branch, or ISIL-K, has moved into other provinces of Afghanistan, including Nuristan, Badghis, Sar-e-Pul, Baghlan, Badakhshan, Kunduz and Kabul, where the fighters have formed sleeper cells, Tolo News reported.The report said that the group has strengthened its positions in and around Kabul, where it conducts most of its attacks, targeting minorities, activists, government employees and personnel of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.The report said that most recently, Daesh had claimed responsibility for the brutal attack of June 8, wherein 10 humanitarian deminers working with HALO Trust in Baghlan Province were killed and 16 others were injured.Tolo News said that in its efforts to resurge, the ISIL-K has prioritised the recruitment and training of new supporters; its leaders also hope to attract intransigent Taliban and other militants who reject the Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan between the US and the Taliban, and to recruit fighters from the Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq and other conflict zones.The report stated that the estimates of the strength of Daesh\\'s Khorasan branch range widely, with one member state reporting between 500 and 1,500 fighters and another stating that it may rise to as many as 10,000 over the medium term.\"One member state stressed that ISIL-K was largely underground and clandestine,\" the report said., adding: \"Its leader, Shahab al-Muhajir, alias Sanaullah, cooperates with Sheikh Tamim, head of the al-Sadiq office.\"The report said that Tamim and his office are tasked by the Daesh core group to oversee the network connecting the Khorasan branch with Daesh presences in the wider region.The UN report said that as reported by the UN Monitoring Team in its 12th report to the Security Council Committee established pursuant to Resolution 1988 (2011), Al-Qaeda is present in at least 15 Afghan provinces, primarily in the eastern, southern and south-eastern regions.The report said that Al-Qaeda\\'s weekly Thabat newsletter reports on its operations inside Afghanistan.Tolo News said that the Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) operates under Taliban protection from Kandahar, Helmand and Nimroz provinces.Since the death of Asim Umar in 2019, AQIS has been led by Osama Mahmood, the report said, adding that the group consists mainly of Afghan and Pakistani nationals, as also individuals from Bangladesh, India and Myanmar.On March 30, AQIS commander Dawlat Bek Tajiki (alias Abu Mohammad al-Tajiki) was killed by Afghan forces in Gyan district of Paktika province.\"Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is assessed by the member states to be alive but ailing in Afghanistan. SayfAl Adl, his most likely successor, is reported to remain in the Islamic Republic of Iran,\" the report stated.The member states differ as to what Al Adl\\'s options would be if he is called upon to succeed al-Zawahiri, but most assess that he would have to move as basing himself in Afghanistan might not be an option, the report said.The leadership succession calculations of Al-Qaeda are complicated by the peace process in Afghanistan where, under the Doha agreement of February 2020, the Taliban is committed to suppressing any international terrorist threat, the report said, but added that it is unclear whether Sayf-Al Adl would be able to travel to Afghanistan to take up the position of the leader of Al-Qaeda.The report mentioned that some member states point to his history of living and operating from Africa and assess that he might choose to base himself there.The report also said that the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, IMU, faces financial difficulties and a Taliban that is less accommodating than it used to be, Tolo News said.ALSO READ | High time international community urged Pak to take \\x91verifiable\\x92 action against terror outfits: India at UNALSO READ |\\xa0Support for Afghan Taliban increasing in Pakistan   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if (\\'\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || \\'undefined\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

Official comment from NATO and European Union member Poland has been only to confirm continuing talks on the subject.Ukraine\\x92s air force uses Soviet-made Mig-29 and Su jet fighters to defend its skies and territory from Russia\\x92s military invasion that began Feb. 24 and has appealed for more warplanes to be able to continue the mission in the long run.The air force has been far outnumbered by the much more powerful Russian air force, but Ukrainian pilots have continued to fly combat sorties and claim kills in combat despite repeated assertions by the Russian military that it has suppressed Ukraine\\x92s air power and air defense assets.WHY NOT US WARPLANES?Ukraine\\x92s military pilots aren\\x92t trained to fly U.S. jet fighters and would be far more equipped to handle MiG-29 or Su planes that are currently used by former Soviet-bloc NATO members Poland, Bulgaria and Slovakia.Ukrainian pilots would be able to fly MiGs right away, but Poland isn\\x92t eager to lose significant amounts of its air force without replacements. U.S.-made F-16s are becoming the mainstay of Poland\\x92s air force as it modernizes its military.WHAT IS POLAND\\x92S RESPONSE?Blinken has said there is a \\x93green light\\x94 for Poland to send planes to Ukraine.\\x93We are looking actively now at the question of airplanes that Poland can provide to Ukraine and looking at how we might be able to backfill should Poland decide to supply those planes. I can\\x92t speak to a timeline, but I can just tell you we\\x92re looking at it very, very actively,\\x94 Blinken said on Sunday in Moldova.The response from Poland was restrained, though.\\x93As far as sending planes, I can only repeat that no decisions have been taken on the subject,\\x94 government spokesman Piotr Mueller said.Mueller denied allegations that Poland could be making its airfields available to Ukrainian warplanes. Russia alleges that Romania and some other countries it didn\\x92t name are hosting Ukraine\\x92s warplanes.Meanwhile, Poland has been supportive of Ukraine both politically, supporting it\\x92s territorial integrity and sovereignty, and on a humanitarian level, opening its border to refugees from the non-EU country.WHY IS POLAND NON-COMMITAL?Despite its supportive stance toward Ukraine in its struggle, Warsaw is facing a crucial and challenging decision regarding making its planes available to Ukraine.Russia has warned Ukraine\\x92s neighbors against hosting its warplanes on their territory saying Moscow could consider that as their \\x93engagement in the military conflict.\\x94 That could mean an opening of hostilities.Russia\\x92s words could be taken as a wider warning against aiding Ukraine\\x92s air forces.Poland also borders Russia, through the Kaliningrad exclave, and has a long border with Russia\\x92s close ally Belarus. Relations between Warsaw and Moscow have been at a low point since a right-wing government took office in Poland in 2015.OTHER CONSIDERATIONSOne of the main issues is where these MiGs, if made available, would be based as they couldn\\x92t be on NATO soil. It isn\\x92t clear if Ukraine would be able to safely house and service them in the long run, given the warfare on its territory.Another question to resolve would be how to deliver the planes to Ukraine. Polish pilots, who are also NATO pilots, couldn\\x92t fly them to Ukraine without risking NATO involvement in the conflict, and sending Ukrainian pilots to Poland to fly them back could present similar issues.There is also an F-16 production backlog, which means the countries that potentially give away their MiGs and Su fighters to Ukraine would need to wait for the backfill for some time.U.S. Senator Marco Rubio summed it up by saying: \\x93There\\x92s complications that come with. It\\x92s not just as easy as handing it over. You got to fly those in. You got to station them somewhere on the ground.\\x93And ... the Russians have launched a pretty -- anywhere in between eight to 12 rockets at an airport in the sort of west of Ukraine. And it\\x92s just a part of a strategy to deny them places to move that airframe,\\x94 said Rubio, a Republican from Florida.Also Read |\\xa0Russian banks switch to Chinese UnionPay after withdrawal of Visa, MasterCard', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology, analysed approaches for not only SARS-CoV-2 and its relatives such as SARS-Cov that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and MERS-Cov that causes the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), but also as yet unknown strains which will inevitably emerge in the future.\\x93Coronaviruses represent a true threat to human health and the global economy,\\x94 said Ralph Baric, a professor at the University of North Carolina in the US. \\x93We must first consider novel countermeasures to control the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic virus and then the vast array of high-threat zoonotic viruses that are poised for human emergence in the future,\\x94 Baric said.To help focus the global search for a treatment, the researchers aim to provide a comprehensive resource of possible lines of attack against SARS-Cov-2 and related coronaviruses. They said first, and most effective approach is using vaccines.In the present case, the most successful are likely to carry the receptor binding domain of the virus\\x92s S-protein, which allows it to bind to and fuse with host cells, the researchers said. Besides the traditional live attenuated, inactivated, and subunit-based vaccines, modern types such as DNA/RNA-based and nanoparticle- or viral vector-borne vaccines should be considered, they said.The researchers noted the second-most likely effective are broad-spectrum antivirals such as nucleoside analogues, which mimic the bases in the virus\\x92s RNA genome and get mistakenly incorporated into nascent RNA chains, stalling the copy process. But because coronaviruses have a so-called \\x93proofreading\\x94 enzyme which can cut such mismatches out, most nucleoside analogues don\\x92t work well, according to the researchers.However, exceptions seem to be beta-D-N4-hydroxycytidine and remdesivir, proposed by them as good candidates against SARS-Cov-2, they said.The researchers also analysed nonvalescent blood plasma from patients who recovered, with low levels of a range of antibodies against the virus; or preferably monoclonal antibodies, isolated and mass-produced through biotechnology. Such \\x93passive immunisation\\x94 can give short-term immunity, the said.The most attractive alternative until a vaccine is produced is gene therapy delivered through the adeno-associated virus (AAV), the researchers said. This would entail the fast, targeted delivery of antibodies, immunoadhesins, antiviral peptides, and immunomodulators to the upper airways, to give short-term protection, they said.The researchers noted that because of the rapid turnover of cells here, risks of toxicity are minimal. They estimate that such tools can be developed, adapted, and tested within a month.\\x93AAV-based passive immunisation can be used as a quick alternative. It is straightforward and only contains two components, the viral vector and the antibody. Multiple AAV vectors have been proven to be safe and effective for human use,\\x94 said study co-author Long Ping Victor Tse.\\x93In theory, a single dose could mount a protective response within a week and last for more than a year.

Power cuts that last up to 13 hours a day.', \"Sri Lankan Catholic clergy protest against the economic crisis in ColomboSri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa late Tuesday night revoked the state of emergency he had declared on April 1 with immediate effect in his island nation. In a gazette notification no 2274/10 issued on Tuesday night, the president said he has withdrawn the emergency rule ordinance which gave security forces sweeping powers to curb any disturbance in the country.President Rajapaksa has declared a public emergency on April 1 amid a spate of protests over the worst economic crisis in the country.The emergency was imposed because of the mass scale protests planned for April 3 against the current economic hardships faced by the people.Later, the government imposed an island-wide curfew. Protests continued despite curfew and the state of emergency with senior ruling party figures having their homes surrounded by angry protesters who urged the government for solutions to the economic crisis.Several people were injured and vehicles were set on fire as the agitation turned violent. Police fired tear gas and water cannons at the protesters after they pulled down a steel barricade placed near the president's residence. Following the incident, several people were arrested and a curfew was briefly imposed in most parts of Colombo city.A foreign exchange crunch in Sri Lanka has led to a shortage of essential goods such as fuel and cooking gas. Power cuts that last up to 13 hours a day. The revocation of the gazette assumes significance as the ruling coalition appeared to have lost its majority in the 225 member Parliament with over 40 MPs declaring independence from the ruling coalition.The emergency approval needs to be ratified in the assembly after 2 weeks of it coming into effect.The Opposition demanded in Parliament on Monday to debate the emergency for its approval.The second largest group within the ruling Sri Lanka People's Party (SLPP) coalition had officially conveyed to Rajapaksa that their 14 members would not back the motion.If those who declared independence did not vote with the government there was a chance that emergency regulations could not be passed in the assembly.Sri Lanka is currently experiencing its worst economic crisis in history. With long lines for fuel, cooking gas, essentials in short supply and long hours of power cuts the public has been suffering for weeks.Rajapaksa has defended his government's actions, saying the foreign exchange crisis was not his making and the economic downturn was largely pandemic-driven where the island\\x92s tourism revenue and inward remittances waned.(With inputs from PTI)Also Read |\\xa0Sri Lanka crisis: Rajapaksa\\x92s grip on power weakens; Finance Minister resigns within 24 hours\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

      "[\"Israel to swear in government, ending Netanyahu's long rule\", 'Israel is set to swear in a new government on Sunday that will send Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into the opposition after a record 12 years in office.', \"Israeli protesters dance and cheer during a demonstration against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outside his official residence in JerusalemIsrael is set to swear in a new government on Sunday that will send Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into the opposition after a record 12 years in office and end a political crisis that sparked four elections in two years. Naftali Bennett, the head of a small ultranationalist party, will take over as prime minister. But if he wants to keep the job, he will have to maintain an unwieldy coalition of parties from the political right, left and center.The eight parties, including a small Arab faction that is making history by sitting in the ruling coalition, are united in their opposition to Netanyahu and new elections but agree on little else. They are likely to pursue a modest agenda that seeks to reduce tensions with the Palestinians and maintain good relations with the U.S. without launching any major initiatives.Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, remains the head of the largest party in parliament and is expected to vigorously oppose the new government. If just one faction bolts, it could lose its majority and would be at risk of collapse, giving him an opening to return to power.The new government is promising a return to normalcy after a tumultuous two years that saw four elections, an 11-day Gaza war last month and a coronavirus outbreak that devastated the economy before it was largely brought under control by a successful vaccination campaign.The driving force behind the coalition is Yair Lapid, a political centrist who will become prime minister in two years, if the government lasts that long.Israel's parliament, known as the Knesset, will convene to vote on the new government at 4 pm local time. It is expected to win a narrow majority of at least 61 votes in the 120-member assembly, after which it will be sworn in. The government plans to hold its first official meeting later this evening.It's unclear if Netanyahu will attend the ceremony or when he will move out of the official residence. He has lashed out at the new government in apocalyptic terms and accused Bennett of defrauding voters by running as a right-wing stalwart and then partnering with the left.Netanyahu's supporters have held angry protests outside the homes of rival lawmakers, who say they have received death threats naming their family members. Israel's Shin Bet internal security service issued a rare public warning about the incitement earlier this month, saying it could lead to violence.Netanyahu has condemned the incitement while noting that he has also been a target. His place in Israeli history is secure, having served as prime minister for a total of 15 years \\x97 more than any other, including the country's founder, David Ben-Gurion.Netanyahu began his long rule by defying the Obama administration, refusing to freeze settlement construction as it tried unsuccessfully to revive the peace process. Relations with Israel's closest ally grew even rockier when Netanyahu vigorously campaigned against President Barack Obama's emerging nuclear deal with Iran, even denouncing it in an address to the US Congress.But he suffered few if any consequences from those clashes and was richly rewarded by the Trump administration, which recognized contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital, helped broker normalization agreements with four Arab states and withdrew the U.S. from the Iran deal.Netanyahu has portrayed himself as a world-class statesman, boasting of his close ties with Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has also cultivated ties with Arab and African countries that long shunned Israel over its policies toward the Palestinians.But he has gotten a far chillier reception from the Biden administration and is widely seen as having undermined the long tradition of bipartisan support for Israel in the United States.His reputation as a political magician has also faded at home, where he has become a deeply polarizing figure. Critics say he has long pursued a divide-and-conquer strategy that aggravated rifts in Israeli society between Jews and Arabs and between his close ultra-Orthodox allies and secular Jews.In November 2019, he was indicted for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. He refused calls to step down, instead lashing out at the media, judiciary and law enforcement, going so far as to accuse his political opponents of orchestrating an attempted coup. Last year, protesters began holding weekly rallies across the country calling on him to resign.\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

Among them is Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, another key figure in the probe.The administration has struggled to come up with a unified response to the quickly progressing investigation. Democrats have warned that defying their demands will in itself be considered \\x93evidence of obstruction\\x94 and a potentially impeachable offense.Pompeo has become a key figure in the Democrats\\x92 investigation. He was on the line during the July phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter \\x97 sparking a whistleblower complaint and now the impeachment inquiry.Pompeo had initially tried to delay a handful of current and former officials from cooperating with the inquiry and accused Democrats trying to \\x93bully\\x94 his staffers.On Saturday, Pompeo did not back off his defense of Trump\\x92s call with Ukraine.\\x93There has been some suggestion somehow that it would be inappropriate for the United States government to engage in that activity and I see it just precisely the opposite,\\x94 he said.Trump has offered a series of contradictory statements when it comes to the Democrats\\x92 subpoena of White House records.Asked Wednesday whether the White House intended to comply, Trump told reporters, \\x93I always cooperate,\\x94 even as he dismissed the inquiry as \\x93a hoax.\\x94 A day later, however, Trump had a different answer for the same question, saying he would instead leave the matter to his lawyers.\\x93That\\x92s up to them to decide,\\x94 he said, \\x93But the whole investigation is crumbling.\\x94By Friday, however, Trump confirmed reports the White House was preparing a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., arguing that Congress cannot undertake an impeachment investigation without first having a vote to authorize it. Pelosi has insisted the House is well within its rules to conduct oversight of the executive branch under the Constitution regardless.It was unclear Saturday when or if that letter would be sent.Pompeo, meanwhile, made clear that the State Department had yet to turn over any document, but intended to follow a proper review. And he said he would do so faster than the Obama administration.\\x93I remember precisely once when I was on that side and we were looking for documents, I remember precisely how long it took for those documents to come across,\\x94 he said in an apparent reference to his experience as a congressman during the investigation into the 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya.\\x93We\\x92re going to beat that. We\\x92re going to be more responsive than the Obama administration was in the years that preceded this particular Congress,\\x94 he said.A congressional aide familiar with Pompeo\\x92s response confirmed that the State Department had indeed been in contact, even if Pompeo had failed to meet a Friday deadline to produce documents required by the subpoena.Trump, meanwhile, continued to seethe Saturday, denouncing the investigation as yet another \\x93Witch Hunt!\\x94 and \\x93a fraud against the American people!\\x94In a series of tweets Saturday, including several sent as his presidential motorcade ferried him back and forth to his Virginia golf course, Trump defended his conduct and lashed out at critics, including a past foil, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah.\\x93I\\x92m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake. I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats!\\x94 Trump wrote. He ended his tweet with an extraordinary call to impeach a senator from his own party.Yet Romney was joined Saturday in his criticism by a second Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, who said \\x93it\\x92s not OK\\x94 for a president to encourage a foreign state to investigate a political rival.Speaking after a firefighter memorial service in Maine, Collins said Trump made a \\x93big mistake\\x94 when he piled on his outreach to Ukraine by publicly calling on China to investigate the Bidens.Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska is the only other Republican senator to publicly criticize the president\\x92s comments that further fueled an impeachment inquiry.Lawmakers are focused on Trump\\x92s efforts to push Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. A whistleblower complaint said that Trump sought to use military assistance for Ukraine as leverage to push the newly elected Zelenskiy to launch an inquiry into the 2020 Democratic hopeful.Late Thursday, House investigators released a cache of text messages that showed top U.S. diplomats encouraging Zelenskiy to conduct an investigation linked to Biden\\x92s family in return for granting a high-profile visit with Trump in Washington.The release followed a 10-hour interview with one of the diplomats, Kurt Volker, who stepped down as special envoy to Ukraine after the impeachment inquiry had begun.Also Read:\\xa0Canada to Kartarpur via Paris: Bus with Sikh pilgrims crosses Atlantic Ocean on ship | Watch videoAlso Read:\\xa0Once an ally, Pakistan Army Chief Gen Bajwa slowly creates problems for PM Imran Khan', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

Lion Air was allowed to resume flights to Europe as of June 2016, and the ban on all other Indonesian airlines was lifted earlier this year.The U.S. lifted a decadelong ban in 2016.Last month, two Lion Air-owned aircraft had a wingtip strike while they were on the tarmac at Jakarta's airport. An investigation attributed the incident to a rushed departure. In April, a Lion Air Boeing 737-800 overran the runway at Gorontalo Airport on the island of Sulawesi. Afterward, investigators and the airline issued instructions on improving safety awareness and procedures.No one was reported injured in either of those incidents, according to reports on the website Aviation Safety Network.Lion Air announced early this year that it was among three major Indonesian airlines, including Garuda Indonesia and Batik Air, that were upgraded to the highest level of safety rating after Indonesia passed a key international audit under the International Civil Aviation Organization's Universal Safety Oversight Audit Program.Lion Air has been expanding bullishly in Southeast Asia, a fast-growing region of more than 600 million people.

This is the third time that Air India flights from India have been banned by the Hong Kong government for bringing passengers who tested positive for the infection after arrival. Previous bans were during September 20-October 3 and August 18-August 31.Vistara\\'s flights are being banned for the first time by the Hong Kong government during the coronavirus pandemic.Passengers from India can arrive in Hong Kong only if they have a COVID-19 negative certificate from a test done within 72 hours prior to the journey, according to rules issued by the Hong Kong government in July. Moreover, all international passengers are required to undergo a post-flight COVID-19 test at the Hong Kong airport.Besides India, a pre-flight COVID-19 negative certificate is mandatory for all passengers from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa and the US, according to the Hong Kong government\\'\\'s rules.An airline operating a flight to Hong Kong from any of these nine countries has to submit a form before departure, stating that all passengers onboard have COVID-19 negative certificates.When asked for a statement on the recent ban on its Hong Kong flights, Air India spokesperson told PTI, \"Only passengers with COVID-negative reports are being allowed to board from India (as per the rules of the Hong Kong government).\"Another mandatory COVID-19 test is being carried out for passengers after landing in Hong Kong and reports of the same may vary from the reports of tests conducted 72 hours before taking the flight, the spokesperson noted.\"Hence, Air India cannot be held responsible for any lacunae on the issue of passenger test reports,\" the spokesperson added. Air India has just four flights scheduled for Hong Kong between October 17 and October 30, the spokesperson said.The spokesperson said Air India is following all rules and protocols of the Hong Kong government and they are clearly communicated to passengers on its website.Vistara did not comment on the ban on its flights to Hong Kong.\"A few passengers who travelled on Delhi-Hong Kong flight of Air India and Chennai-Hong Kong flight of Vistara on Thursday tested positive for COVID-19 post arrival,\" the senior government official said.\"Consequently, the flights of these two airlines have been barred from October 17 to October 30 by the Hong Kong government,\" the official added. Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 due to the pandemic.However, the Indian airlines have been permitted to operate special international flights under the Vande Bharat mission since May this year and under the bilateral air bubble pacts since July this year.Under a bilateral air bubble pact, the airlines of both countries can operate international flights with certain restrictions.

A Taliban victory, likewise, does not mean a better future for that country. Very likely, Taliban rule will vary across the provinces,\" Ullman said.\"In some cases, local war lords will remain in power, accommodate the Taliban or suffer strangulation by being cut-off from access beyond its limited areas of control. That could ignite local outbreaks of civil war and insurgencies against the Taliban. Whether these will be persistent and widespread will depend on the brutality of Taliban rule and the capacity of Afghans to continue the fight after decades of violence and conflict,\" he added.Ullman believes that Pakistan will attempt to impose greater influence on the Taliban through the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI) and this will doom \"Prime Minister Imran Khan\\'s outreach to improve relations with the U.S. to failure.\"\"The U.S. has no illusions about Pakistan\\'s past duplicity in denying its support of the Afghan Taliban.

The spokesperson, Kyi Toe, and at least one other party member are now in custody, DPA news agency quoted party member Phyo Zayar Thaw as saying.Kyi Toe has been the NLD member most often in contact with the media since the February 1 coup and the most responsible for sharing the party's comments in recent weeks.The other detainee is reportedly a youth member of the NLD.Friday's development came a day after new allegations were levelled against Suu Kyi.In a TV broadcast, U Maung Weik, a business owner, was seen explaining how he handed over envelopes full of cash to Suu Kyi or her associates starting in 2017.In all, Weik said he had handed over a total of $550,000 during four separate incidents.A news reader said the businessman has been found guilty of bribery and that the country's anti-corruption commission is investigating.After Suu Kyi was dislodged by the February 1 coup, the military has piled on charges against her, from illegally importing walkie-talkies to sowing disorder by inducing others to commit offences against the state to mishandling the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic.The coup was staged as the military alleged massive voting fraud in the 2020 general elections, which NLD win a majority of seats in both houses of parliament.In response to the coup, Myanmar has witnessed continued protests demanding the release of the former de facto leader and other senior officials, as well as restoring the democratically elected government.While more than 200 protesters have been killed in firings by security forces across Myanmar, mostly in cities like Yangon, Mandalay, and Dawei, over 600 others suffered serious injuries, some life-threatening or delibitating.ALSO READ |\\xa0Martial law imposed in parts of Myanmar city as deaths rise\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

He said, another terror attack, is \\'highly likely\\' this weekend as the US winds down its evacuation.The Pentagon said that the remaining contingent of US forces at the airport, now numbering less than 4,000, had begun their final withdrawal ahead of Joe Biden\\x92s deadline for ending the evacuation on Tuesday.After getting briefed on a US drone mission in eastern Afghanistan that the Pentagon said killed two members of the Islamic State (IS) group\\x92s Afghanistan affiliate early Saturday, Biden added the extremists can expect more.\\xa0\\x93This strike was not the last,\\x94 Biden said in a statement. \\x93We will continue to hunt down any person involved in that heinous attack and make them pay.\\x94 He paid tribute to the \\x93bravery and selflessness\\x94 of the American troops executing the hurried airlift of tens of thousands from Kabul airport, including the 13 U.S. service members who were killed in Thursday\\x92s suicide bombing at an airport gate.The evacuation proceeded as tensions rose over the prospect of another IS attack.\\x93Our commanders informed me that an attack is highly likely in the next 24-36 hours,\\x94 Biden said, adding that he has instructed them to take all possible measures to protect their troops, who are securing the airport and helping bring onto the airfield Americans and others desperate to escape Taliban rule.The remains of the 13 American troops were on their way to the United States, the Pentagon said. Their voyage marked a painful moment in a nearly 20-year American war that cost more than 2,400 U.S. military lives and is ending with the return to power of a Taliban movement that was ousted when U.S. forces invaded in October 2001.The remains of troops killed in action overseas are usually flown back to the U.S. via Dover Air Base in Delaware, where fallen troops\\x92 return to U.S. soil is marked by a solemn movement known as the \\x93dignified transfer.\\x94The White House on Saturday did not say if Biden would travel to Dover for the troops\\x92 return. Biden\\x92s press secretary, Jen Psaki, said shortly after the attack that the president \\x93would do everything he can to honor the sacrifice and the service\\x94 of those killed.The Pentagon released the names of those killed- 11 Marines, one Navy sailor and one Army soldier. Twelve of them were in the 20s; some were born in 2001, the year America\\x92s longest war began. The oldest was 31.They were the first U.S. service members killed in Afghanistan since February 2020, the month the Trump administration struck an agreement with the Taliban in which the militant group halted attacks on Americans in exchange for a U.S. agreement to remove all troops and contractors by May 2021. Biden announced in April that the 2,500 to 3,000 troops who remained would be out by September, ending what he has called America\\x92s forever war.With Biden\\x92s approval, the Pentagon this month sent thousands of additional troops to the Kabul airport to provide security and to facilitate the State Department\\x92s chaotic effort to evacuate thousands of Americans and tens of thousands of Afghans who had helped the United States during the war. The evacuation was marred by confusion and chaos as the U.S. government was caught by surprise when the Afghan army collapsed and the Taliban swept to power Aug. 15.About 5,400 Americans have been evacuated from the country so far, including 300 in the last day. The State Department believes about 350 more want out; it said there are roughly 280 others who have said they are Americans but who have not told the State Department of their plans to leave the country, or who have said they plan to remain.Untold numbers of vulnerable Afghans, fearful of a return to the brutality of pre-2001 Taliban rule, are likely to be left behind. Biden and the leaders of other Western countries have said they would try to work with the Taliban to allow Afghans who had worked with them to leave after the U.S.-led evacuation ends.The Pentagon said that about 6,800 people, mostly Afghans, were flown out in the 24 hours that ended Saturday morning, bringing to 113,500 the total number of people of all nationalities evacuated since the hurried exit was begun Aug. 14.Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. military force at the Kabul airport, which peaked at about 5,800, had begun its final withdrawal. The number had dropped below 4,000 on Saturday, according to a U.S. official who discussed details not yet publicly released on condition of anonymity. Kirby said that for security reasons the Pentagon will not provide a day-by-day description of the final stages of the military\\x92s withdrawal, which includes flying home troops as well as equipment.The Pentagon said an airstrike early Saturday local time in the eastern province of Nangarhar, which borders Pakistan, killed two IS \\x93planners and facilitators.\\x94\\x93They have lost some capability to plan and to conduct missions, but make no mistake, nobody\\x92s writing this off and saying, \\x91Well, we got them. We don\\x92t have to worry about ISIS-K anymore.\\x92 Not the case,\\x94 Kirby told a news conference, using an abbreviation for the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan.Biden also faces the problem over the longer term of containing an array of potential extremist threats based in Afghanistan, which will be harder with fewer U.S. intelligence assets and no military presence in the nation. Critics say Biden\\x92s withdrawal from Afghanistan leaves the door open for al-Qaida, the Islamic State and other extremist groups to grow and potentially threaten the United States. It was al-Qaida\\x92s use of Afghanistan as a base, with the Taliban\\x92s acquiescence, that prompted the United States to invade the country in October 2001, beginning the longest war in U.S. history.Saturday\\x92s drone mission came less than two days after the Kabul attack and a public pledge by Biden that he would make IS \\x93pay\\x94 for their suicide bomb attack. Officials made no claim that the two individuals killed played a direct role in Thursday\\x92s Kabul airport attack.Kirby declined to release the names and nationalities of the two killed. He said one other person was wounded in the strike. The speed with which the U.S. retaliated reflected its close monitoring of IS and years of experience in targeting extremists in remote parts of the world. But it also shows the limits of U.S. power to eliminate the threat from extremists, who some believe will have more freedom of movement in Afghanistan now that the Taliban is in power.Kirby said the U.S. had \\x93the ability and the means to carry over-the-horizon counterterrorism capabilities and we\\x92re going to defend ourselves,\\x94 referring to the military\\x92s use of aircraft based in the Persian Gulf area and elsewhere to carry out strikes in Afghanistan.(With inputs from AP)   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if (\\'\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || \\'undefined\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

He was originally charged with capital murder by authorities in the US state of Texas.Mathews stared ahead and did not look at jurors as the judge sentenced him to life in prison, US media reports said.The 12-member jury deliberated Wednesday afternoon for about three hours before coming to a unanimous decision to give Mathews a sentence of life in the death of his adopted daughter, Sherin.Prosecutors argued that Mathews, hailing from Kerala, killed Sherin in October 2017. She was adopted by Mathews and his wife Sini Mathews from an orphanage in Bihar in 2016. Mathews claimed she accidentally choked to death on milk.While prosecutors asked the jury to hand down a life sentence, defence attorney Rafael De La Garza argued that Mathews was a good father who panicked when his daughter choked and did not call for help.After the verdict was read, De La Garza called the sentence \"cruel and unusual punishment\", WFAA TV reported.Mathews initially told police that Sherin went missing on October 7, 2017, after he put her outside their home at 3 am in Richardson, Texas because she would not drink her milk. Her badly decomposed body was found 15 days later in a culvert near the family\\'s home.His story evolved during the course of the investigation. He originally told police that Sherin was alive when he put her outside.\\xa0He later admitted she died when he \"physically assisted\" her in drinking the milk and got chocked.On the witness stand during the sentencing trial, Mathews said he panicked after his daughter\\'s accidental death. He said he wrapped her body in a blue trash bag and put her in a culvert so she would be near the home.Police charged Sherin\\'s foster mother Sini with child abandonment in November 2017, after her husband told officials the couple left the toddler alone the night of her death while they went to dinner with their biological daughter.Sini\\'s case was dismissed in March this year after prosecutors said they could not prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

The country is currently fighting an acute food shortage while trying to manage the coronavirus pandemic.To quell discontent among his people, the Supreme Leader has ordered people to hand over their pet dogs. He used class difference as an excuse to justify the move, which has been described as brutal and inhuman.According to a report by The Mirror, he said that the ordinary people raise livestock and cattle while only the rich and elite have pet dogs. He called having pet dogs a sign of \"capitalism\" and \"bourgeois ideology.\"Dogs in North Korea have always been associated with capitalist notions and the rule banning pet dogs has been implemented on and off since the 1980s.According to the South China Morning Post, in 2018, North Korea asked its people to give up their dogs\\' fur ahead of the Party Foundation Day (one of North Korea\\'s biggest and most important holidays). If they refused, they would have to hand over the US $148 worth of rice to the state.Kim Jong-un, whose focus has been to improve the country\\x92s defence, has spent a lot of resources to develop and test nuclear weapons. Now, owing to a fall in trade with China, its economic condition has worsened. According to the UN, several families are able to afford only one meal a day. Approximately 60 per cent of the 25.5 million population in North Korea is suffering from starvation.According to multiple reports, North Korea has also been facing a shortage of food. The New York Times reported once confiscation of pooches begins in Pyongyang, some of them will be sent to zoos and some to restaurants for meat.Authorities have been tasked to identify families in North Korea with pet dogs, and it is highly likely that the family will not be able to do much once authorities are at their doorstep to take away their pets.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

But does anyone know where exactly is Santa Claus at present? What if you can track Santa Claus, just like you do while ordering online food? North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) is tracking the live status of Santa, so that your wait for Christmas presents gets a timeline. NORAD has been tracking Santa\\'s sleigh since 4 am on Tuesday, right when Santa Claus embarked his flight with his nine reindeer.His first stops were in eastern Russia and Asia, just in time for Christmas Day there.Not just NORAD, US space agency NASA is also keeping an eye on Santa\\x92s sleigh.\\xa0Those who want to know the exact location status of Santa Claus can track his journey on NORAD\\'s official Santa Tracker, Moreover, you can also call 1-877-HI-NORAD (1-877-446-6723) to speak live with NORAD trackers. The group uses infrared sensors to follow the glow of Rudolph\\'s nose, enabling them to pinpoint the location of his sleigh.\"We are proud to carry on the tradition of tracking Santa as he travels along his yuletide flight path,\" NORAD commander Terrence O\\'Shaughnessy was quoted by CNN as saying.\\xa0\\xa0What is NORAD?\\xa0North American Aerospace Defense Command comes up with an annual Christmas-themed program that starts on December 1. The actual Santa-tracking starts at midnight of December 23. The program is in the tradition of the September 1897 editorial \"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus\" in the New York Sun.\\xa0How did Santa tracking begin?On December 24, 1948, the United States Air Force issued a communique claiming that an \"early warning radar net to the north\" had detected \"one unidentified sleigh, powered by eight reindeer, at 14,000 feet [4,300 meters], heading 180 degrees.\" The Associated Press passed this \"report\" along to the general public. It was the first time that the United States Armed Forces issued a statement about tracking Santa Claus\\'s sleigh on Christmas Eve, although it was a one-time event, not repeated over the next several years.The program originated before the actual formation of NORAD, as an annual event on December 24, 1955. On November 30, the same year, a child trying to reach Santa Claus on a hotline number provided in a Sears advertisement misdialed the number and instead reached Shoup at his desk at CONAD. Shoup responded gruffly to the child and no additional Santa Claus-related calls came in to CONAD.According to legend, a Sears department store then placed an advertisement in the Colorado Springs newspaper The Gazette, which told children that they could place a call to Santa Claus and included the number ME 2-6681.In some versions of the story, the calls were coming in to the \"red telephone\" hotline that connected CONAD directly to command authorities at the Strategic Air Command.

      "['Iran announces arrests over downing of Ukrainian plane that killed 176 passengers', '?Iran\\x92s judiciary said Tuesday that arrests have been made for the accidental shootdown of a Ukrainian passenger plane that killed all 176 people on board just after takeoff from Tehran last week.', 'Wreckage of the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 at the scene of the crash in Shahedshahr, southwest of the capital Tehran, Iran. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP)\\xa0Iran\\x92s judiciary said Tuesday that arrests have been made for the accidental shootdown of a Ukrainian passenger plane that killed all 176 people on board just after takeoff from Tehran last week.The announcement came amid an upswell of anger and protests by Iranians in recent days over the downing of the jetliner last Wednesday and apparent attempts by senior officials in Iran to cover-up the cause of the crash.Iran, which initially dismissed allegations that a missile had brought down the plane, acknowledged only on Saturday \\x97 three days after and in the face of mounting evidence \\x97 that its Revolutionary Guard had shot down the plane by mistake.Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili was quoted by Iranian state media saying that \\x93extensive investigations have taken place and some individuals are arrested.\\x94 He did not say how many individuals had been detained or name them.Iran\\x92s president on Tuesday also called for a special court to be set up to probe the incident.\\x93The judiciary should form a special court with a ranking judge and dozens of experts,\\x94 President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech televised in Iran. \\x93This is not an ordinary case. The entire the world will be watching this court.\\x94Rouhani called the incident \\x93a painful and unforgivable\\x94 mistake and promised that his administration would pursue the case \\x93by all means.\\x94\\x93The responsibility falls on more than just one person,\\x94 he said, adding that those found culpable \\x93should be punished.\\x94\\x93There are others, too, and I want that this issue is expressed honestly,\\x94 he said, without elaborating.Rouhani called the government\\x92s admission that Iranian forces shot down the plane the \\x93first good step\\x94.The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians \\x97 including many Iranians with dual citizenship \\x97 and 11 Ukrainians, according to officials. There were several children among the passengers, including an infant.Iran shot down the plane when it was bracing for possible U.S. retaliation for a ballistic missile attack on two military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq. No one was hurt in that attack, which was carried out to avenge the stunning killing of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in an American airstrike in Baghdad.Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Guard\\x92s aerospace division, said over the weekend his unit accepts full responsibility for the shootdown. He said when he learned about the downing of the plane, \\x93I wished I was dead.\\x94The incident raised questions about why Iran did not shut down its international airport or airspace the day it was bracing for U.S. military retaliation.The shootdown and the lack of transparency around it has reignited anger in Iran at the country\\x92s leadership. Online videos appeared to show security forces firing live ammunition and tear gas to disperse protests in the streets.Also Tuesday, Iran\\x92s judiciary said that 30 people had been detained in the protests, and that some were released, without elaborating further.Iranian authorities briefly arrested British Ambassador Rob Macaire on Saturday evening. He\\x92s said he went to a candlelight vigil to pay his respects for the victims of the Ukrainian plane shootdown and left as soon as the chanting began and it turned into a protest.Iran\\x92s Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador on Sunday to protest what it said was his presence at an illegal protest. Britain, in turn, summoned Iran\\x92s ambassador on Monday \\x93to convey our strong objections\\x94 over the weekend arrest.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

      "['Afghanistan crisis: US says up to 1,500 Americans await airlift as threats grow', 'Untold thousands of at-risk Afghans are struggling to get into the airport even as many thousands of other Afghans already had been flown to safety in nearly two weeks of round-the-clock flights.', 'The United States says as many as 1,500 Americans may be awaiting evacuation from Afghanistan amid growing warnings Thursday of terrorist threats targeting the Kabul airport as President Joe Biden\\'s deadline for withdrawing troops fast approaches.Untold thousands of at-risk Afghans are struggling to get into the airport even as many thousands of other Afghans already had been flown to safety in nearly two weeks of round-the-clock flights.The airlift continued Thursday despite warnings of vehicle-borne bomb threats near the airport. The White House said 13,400 people had been evacuated in the 24 hours that ended early Thursday morning Washington time. That included 5,100 people aboard U.S. military planes and 8,300 on coalition and partner aircraft. That was a substantial drop from the 19,000 airlifted by all means the day before.Several of the Americans working phones and trying to pull strings to get out former Afghan colleagues, women\\'s advocates, journalists, and other vulnerable Afghans said they were still waiting for U.S. action.\\x93It\\'s 100% up to the Afghans to take these risks and try to fight their way out,\\x94 said Sunil Varghese, policy director with the International Refugee Assistance Project.Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized at a State Department briefing on Wednesday that \\x93 evacuating Americans is our top priority.\\x94He added: \\x93We\\'re also committed to getting out as many Afghans at-risk as we can before the 31st,\" when Biden plans to pull out the last of thousands of American troops.As more nations began shutting down their evacuation flights and pulling out before the U.S. withdrawal, there were new European warnings about the threats. British Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told the BBC that there was \\x94very, very credible reporting of an imminent attack\\x94 at the airport, possibly within \\x93hours.\\x94The U.S. Embassy in Kabul, the capital, issued a security alert Wednesday warning American citizens away from three specific airport gates. Senior U.S. officials said the warning was related to ongoing and specific threats involving the Islamic State and potential vehicle bombs, which have set U.S. officials on edge in the final days of the American drawdown. The officials insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing military operations.Blinken said the State Department estimates about 6,000 Americans were wanting to leave Afghanistan when the airlift began Aug. 14, as the Taliban took the capital after a stunning military conquest. About 4,500 Americans have been evacuated so far, Blinken said, and among the rest \\x93some are understandably very scared.\\x94The 6,000 figure is the first firm estimate by the State Department of how many Americans were seeking to get out. U.S. officials early in the evacuation estimated as many as 15,000, including dual citizens, lived in Afghanistan. The figure does not include U.S. Green Card holders.About 500 Americans have been contacted with instructions on when and how to get to the chaotic Kabul airport to catch evacuation flights.In addition, 1,000 or perhaps fewer are being contacted to determine whether they still want to leave. Blinken said some of these may already have left the country, some may want to remain and some may not be American citizens.Blinken emphasized that the U.S. and other governments plan to continue assisting Afghans and Americans who want to leave after the deadline for Biden\\'s planned end to the evacuation and the two-decade U.S. military role in Afghanistan.Biden has cited what the U.S. says are rising security threats to U.S. forces, including from an affiliate of the Islamic State terror group, for his determination to stick with Tuesday\\'s withdrawal deadline.The U.S. Embassy has already been evacuated; staff is operating from the Kabul airport and the last are to leave by Tuesday.Biden said this week he had asked his national security team for contingency plans in case he decides to extend the deadline. Taliban leaders who took control of Afghanistan this month say they will not tolerate any extensions to the Tuesday deadline. But Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted that \\x93people with legal documents\\x94 will still be able to fly out via commercial flights after Tuesday.U.S. troops are anchoring a multinational evacuation from the airport. The White House says the airlift overall has flown out 82,300 Afghans, Americans, and others on a mix of U.S., international and private flights.The withdrawal comes under a 2020 deal negotiated by President Donald Trump with the Taliban.Refugee groups are describing a different picture than the Biden administration is when it comes to many Afghans: a disorganized, barely-there U.S. evacuation effort that leaves the most desperate to risk beatings and death at Taliban checkpoints. Some Afghans are reported being turned away from the Kabul airport by American forces controlling the gates, despite having approval for flights.U.S. military and diplomatic officials appear to still be compiling lists of eligible Afghans but have yet to disclose how many may be evacuated \\x97 and how \\x97 private Americans and American organizations said.\\x93We still have 1,200 Afghans with visas that are outside the airport and haven\\'t got in,\\x94 said James Miervaldis with No One Left Behind, one of the dozens of veterans groups working to get out Afghans who worked with the U.S. military during America\\'s nearly 20 years of combat in the country. \\x93We\\'re waiting to hear from the US. government and haven\\'t heard yet.\\x94U.S.-based organizations, speaking on background to discuss sensitive matters, cite accounts from witnesses on the ground as saying some American citizens, and family members of Afghans with green cards, still were having trouble pushing and talking their way into the Kabul airport for flights.Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. military will preserve as much airlift capacity at the airport as possible in the coming days. But he added that in the final days and hours there will have to be a balance in getting out U.S. troops and their equipment as well as evacuees.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if (\\'\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || \\'undefined\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

The report to the U.N. Security Council, which was circulated Tuesday, said IS and other terrorist groups have taken advantage of \\x93the disruption, grievances and development setbacks\\x94 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, both on the ground and online.While lockdowns in non-conflict areas suppressed terrorist activity, in conflict areas where pandemic restrictions have less impact the threat from IS, also known by its Arabic acronym Daesh, \\x93has already increased,\\x94 Guterres said.\\x93As pandemic-related restrictions gradually ease, there is an elevated near-term threat of Daesh-inspired attacks outside conflict zones by lone actors or small groups that have been radicalized, incited and possibly directly remotely online,\\x94 he said.The U.N. chief said this exemplifies a wider and evolving risk from the accelerated use of digital technologies during the pandemic, and the potential for \\x93new and emerging technologies to be used for terrorist purposes.\\x94In assessing the Islamic State\\x92s threat, Guterres said its leader, Amir Muhammad Sa\\x92id Abdal-Rahman al-Mawla, \\x93remains reluctant to communicate directly with supporters,\\x94 and \\x93the group\\x92s command and control over its global affiliates has loosened, even though it continues to provide guidance and some financial support.\\x94He said the autonomy of regional affiliates has strengthened especially in West Africa and the Sahel, East and Central Africa, Afghanistan and South Asia. This evolution will be an important factor in Daesh\\x92s future global impact, he quoted unidentified U.N. member states as saying.Member states also assess that the extremist group \\x93will continue to prioritize regrouping and seeking resurgence\\x94 in Iraq and Syria as its core area of operations, he said.The 16-page report, prepared by the Security Council counter-terrorism committee and by experts monitoring sanctions on the Islamic State, said the group remains active in wide swaths of Syria, where it is seeking to rebuild its combat capabilities and expand its insurgency.Guterres said IS wages hit-and-run operations against checkpoints from hideouts on both sides of the Euphrates River in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour and continues operations against government forces and in the Syrian desert.In Iraq, IS remains under constant counter-terrorism pressure but continues to carry out hit-and-run operations \\x93seeking to undermine critical infrastructure projects, inflame sectarian divisions and communal grievances and generate media coverage,\\x94 he said.As for the extremist group\\x92s finances, the U.N. chief said estimates of financial reserves available to IS in Iraq and Syria range between $25 million and $50 million, with one unidentified U.N. member state saying most funds are in Iraq.The secretary-general said the most striking development in the first half of 2021 has been the expansion of IS in Africa, where terrorist groups have inflicted the largest number of casualties.He said some of the most effective IS affiliates are spreading their influence and activities from Mali into Burkina Faso and Niger, from Nigeria into Niger, Chad and Cameroon, and from Mozambique into Tanzania.\\x93It highlights that the interplay between terrorism, fragility and conflict has grown stronger, and underscores the need for an urgent, global response to support African countries and regional organizations,\\x94 Guterres said.In Afghanistan, he said, the IS affiliate has expanded its presence in several provinces and in and around the capital Kabul, \\x93despite leadership, human and financial losses during 2020.\\x94 In Kabul, most of its attacks have targeted minorities, civil society actors, government employees and security forces, he said.In the Islamic State\\x92s efforts to regroup and rebuild in Afghanistan, Guterres said the group has prioritized the recruitment and training of new supporters and hopes to attract Taliban members and other militants who reject the U.S.-Taliban agreement as well as fighters from Iraq.Estimates of IS strength in Afghanistan range widely, from 500 to 1,500 fighters, with one unidentified U.N. member state saying its strength may rise to 10,000 in the medium term, he said.Guterres said U.N. member states have already warned \\x93that Daesh could regain the ability to orchestrate international attacks if either its core or one of its regional affiliates became strong enough.\\x94\\x93This scenario has only become more plausible,\\x94 the U.N. chief warned.Also Read |\\xa0Islamic State commander arrested in Jammu   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if (\\'\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || \\'undefined\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

About five years ago, the Democratic Party\\'s presidential nominee learned that there are five Bidens living in Mumbai, but is probably yet to make a connection with them.The \\'Biden from Mumbai\\', then known as Bombay, had congratulated Biden on his election as the senator from Delaware and told him that they were related to each other.Biden, then 29, wanted to follow up on the letter and get in touch with the \\'Biden from Mumbai\\'. However, his family and active life in politics meant that this wish remained a wish, something he still wants to fulfil nearly five decades later.The wish may have remained unfulfilled, but the 77-year-old Biden never misses a chance to narrate the \\'Biden from Mumbai\\' story when he meets Indian-Americans and the Indian leaders.The former vice president assures them that he too has an India connection, however, distant it might be.In his address to the Bombay Stock Exchange, Mumbai, on July 24, 2013, during his maiden visit to India as the Vice President of the US, he went off-script to narrate his story of the \\'Biden from Mumbai\\'.\"It\\'s an honour to be back in India and to be here in Mumbai.

Suggesting that our mutual, great, great, great, something or other worked for the East India Trading Company back in the 1700s and came to Mumbai,\" Biden said.A few years later at another speech in Washington DC, Biden said that their forefathers were same, who worked for the East India Company and visited India then.\"He (Biden from Mumbai) went back to our mutual great, great, great grandfather, 1848, who was a British captain in the East India Tea Company. And he married I believe an Indian woman.

      "['Israeli PM, Joe Biden postpone meeting because of Afghanistan', 'Biden and Bennett were scheduled to meet late Thursday morning for their first face-to-face conversation since Bennett became Israel\\x92s prime minister in June.', 'Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett meets with Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the Willard Hotel in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 25, 2021President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett have postponed their White House meeting as Biden focused his attention on dealing with the aftermath of deadly explosions near the Kabul airport that targeted U.S. troops and Afghans seeking to flee their country after the Taliban takeover.Biden and Bennett were scheduled to meet late Thursday morning for their first face-to-face conversation since Bennett became Israel\\x92s prime minister in June. The two will instead meet on Friday.\\x93On behalf of the people of Israel, I share our deep sadness over the loss of American lives in Kabul,\\x94 Bennett said in a statement posted on social media. \\x93Israel stands with the United States in these difficult times, just as America has always stood with us. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of the United States.\\x94Before arriving in Washington, Bennett made clear the top priority of the visit was to persuade Biden not to return to the Iran nuclear deal, arguing Tehran has already advanced in its uranium enrichment, and that sanctions relief would give Iran more resources to back Israel\\x92s enemies in the region.The Israeli leader met separately Wednesday with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to discuss Iran and other issues. The visit is his first to the U.S. as prime minister.Bennett told his Cabinet before the trip that he would tell the American president \\x93that now is the time to halt the Iranians, to stop this thing\\x94 and not to reenter \\x93a nuclear deal that has already expired and is not relevant, even to those who thought it was once relevant.\\x94Biden has made clear his desire to find a path to salvage the 2015 landmark pact cultivated by Barack Obama\\x92s administration but scuttled in 2018 by Donald Trump\\x92s. But U.S. indirect talks with Iran have stalled and Washington continues to maintain crippling sanctions on the country as regional hostilities simmer.Trump\\x92s decision to withdraw from Iran\\x92s nuclear deal led Tehran to abandon over time every limitation the accord imposed on its nuclear enrichment. The country now enriches a small amount of uranium up to 63%, a short step from weapons-grade levels, compared with 3.67% under the deal. It also spins far more advanced centrifuges and more of them than were allowed under the accord, worrying nuclear nonproliferation experts even though Tehran insists its program is peaceful.Bennett\\x92s Washington visit comes weeks after Ebrahim Raisi was sworn in as Iran\\x92s new president.Raisi, 60, a conservative cleric with close ties to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has suggested he\\x92ll engage with the U.S. But he also has struck a hard-line stance, ruling out negotiations aimed at limiting Iranian missile development and support for regional militias \\x97 something the Biden administration wants to address in a new accord.Administration officials acknowledged that Iran\\x92s potential \\x93breakout\\x94 \\x97 the time needed to amass enough fissile material for a single nuclear weapon \\x97 is now down to a matter of months or less.But a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the scheduled talks, said the administration sees the maximum pressure campaign employed by the Trump administration as having emboldened Iran to push ahead with its nuclear program.Bennett is also looking to turn the page from his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.Netanyahu had a close relationship with Trump after frequently clashing with Obama. Biden, who has met with every Israeli prime minister since Golda Meir, had his own tensions with Netanyahu over the years.During his latest White House campaign, Biden called Netanyahu \\x93counterproductive\\x94 and an \\x93extreme right\\x94 leader.Biden waited nearly a month after his election before making his first call to Netanyahu, raising concerns in Jerusalem and among some Netanyahu backers in Washington that the two would have a difficult relationship. The president called Bennett just hours after he was sworn in as prime minister in June to offer his congratulations.Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of the liberal Jewish advocacy group J Street, said Bennett is intent on building a positive working relationship with the Biden administration. But Ben-Ami, whose group supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, noted that the two leaders are out of sync on several issues in addition to Iran. Bennett opposes the creation of a Palestinian state and supports expansion of settlements in the West Bank, which Biden opposes.In an interview with The New York Times ahead of his visit, Bennett declined to comment on whether he would move to block Biden administration plans to reopen a U.S. consulate for Palestinians in Jerusalem.\\x93The warmth that is going to be projected and the good solid working relationship cannot fully mask the fact that the agenda that Prime Minister Bennett comes to Washington with and the agenda that the Biden administration is pursuing on some of the core issues are still almost as different as they could possibly be,\\x94 Ben-Ami said.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if (\\'\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || \\'undefined\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

India paid USD 23.25 million in regular budget assessments by January 31, 2019, the 30-day due period specified as per UN\\x92s Financial Regulation rules.While it paid its dues on time, India voiced concern that the UN is yet to pay it and other Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs) reimbursements for peacekeeping operations.Also Read | UN faces cash crisis, shuts down headquarters; India pays its share of $23 million\"India, though a developing country, has not only settled all of its dues on time, but has also made part payment for future assessments, both for the regular and peacekeeping budgets,\" India\\x92s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador K Nagaraj Naidu said Friday.\"This is not easy considering the scale of our developmental needs. It would not be remiss that our assessment rates have also been growing, an increase of 13% in the latest update,\\x94 Naidu said.He said that the liquidity crisis at the UN \"has been endemic; its effects have now grown to be more pronounced. Five months ago, in May 2019, we were discussing the liquidity crisis in the peacekeeping budget, today, we are discussing liquidity crisis in regular budget mandates.\\x94Speaking at the General Assembly Fifth Committee (administrative and budgetary matters) main session on \\'Improving the Financial Situation of the United Nations\\x92, Naidu said 27 TCCs, 17 from the Group of 77, including India, are still awaiting their legitimate reimbursements from the closed peacekeeping missions.\"Our expectation is that the problem be discussed and addressed comprehensively. We cannot indefinitely delay dues to the TCCs, while using the same funds to pay others,\\x94 he said.The UN owed India 38 million dollars, among the highest it has to pay to any country, for peacekeeping operations as of March 2019. Naidu pointed out that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has again used closed peacekeeping funds meant to reimburse the troops contributing countries to pay for the salaries of staff thereby \\x93contributing to a false sense of financial soundness.\"Here, we would like to remind the Secretary-General that his obligations to the TCCs are equally important as advocating to member states to meet their financial obligations,\" Naidu said.Only 131 members states have settled their regular budget assessments for the current year. While 63 member states owe US$894 million for the current year, a total of 41 countries are yet to settle their dues from the previous years, which cumulatively stands at US$310 million.Referring to the austerity measures announced by the Secretary General last week in the wake of the financial crisis, Naidu said the measures nudge nations to judiciously use resources but also \\x93pose fundamental questions on the raison d\\'etre of the United Nations.\"The global community still looks at the UN for development, hope and peace. Therefore, we must all recognise the crisis and become part of the solution,\\x94 he said.Naidu noted that while reforms in the peacekeeping budget, like the cash pool and annual assessments, have mitigated to some extent the impact of the liquidity crisis, the underlying problem persists.Out of an approved budget of USD 6.5 billion, USD 3.3 billion is still outstanding and this does not include the US$400 million that remains outstanding for decades for the closed peacekeeping missions.\"The impact of this situation is that the TCCs are not reimbursed on time,\" he said.Naidu said borrowings from the Working Capital Fund, the Special Account and the closed peacekeeping accounts does not seem to have filled the liquidity gap.Since 70 per cent of the budget goes to meet the staff cost of UN officials, which are decided on the \"rather overly generous Noblemaire principle\\x94, he said there was anxiety, perhaps for the first time, of UN staff not being paid.\"This has caused a different kind of anxiety among the staff, different from not being able to implement the mandates. Staff paid out of regular budget perhaps are not as lucky as the staff paid out of peacekeeping budget. In similar situations, their salary could have been paid from the money of TCCs by twisting the reimbursement framework,\\x94 Naidu added.He said among the menu list of austerity measures ?that could perhaps improve the budgetary situation includes adhering to the advance air ticket purchase policy, better management of exchange rate fluctuations, energy-efficient lighting and other environment-friendly practices at the UN Headquarters and duty stations.\"The Gandhi Solar Park, a token gift of India to the UN, which was inaugurated last month, is part of the solution,\\x94 he said referring to the park with 193 solar panels installed on the roof of the UN building that Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated last month during the high-level UN General Assembly session.India said a sustainable solution to deal with the financial crisis would emerge only when member states begin to honour their budgetary obligations in full and on time.\"Paying on time and in full is not just the easy solution, but the desired one,\" Naidu said.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

Such a surge would overwhelm hospitals, which now have just 3,000 intensive care unit beds statewide.New York authorities mobilized to head off a potential public health disaster in the city Wednesday, with its emergence as the nation\\x92s biggest coronavirus hot spot a warning flare \\x97 and perhaps a cautionary tale \\x97 for the rest of the country.A makeshift morgue was set up outside Bellevue Hospital, and the city\\x92s police, their ranks dwindling as more fall ill, were told to patrol nearly empty streets to enforce social distancing.Public health officials hunted down beds and medical equipment and put out a call for more doctors and nurses for fear the number of sick will explode in a matter of weeks, overwhelming hospitals as has happened in Italy and Spain. Spanish lawmakers agreed to extending by two weeks a state of emergency that has allowed the government to maintain a national lockdown.In Washington, President Trump implored Congress to move on critical coronavirus aid without further delay. Senate leaders were trying to overcome late objections to a $2 trillion economic rescue package to ease the financial pain of the pandemic.Worldwide, the death toll climbed past 20,000, according to a running count kept by Johns Hopkins University. The number of dead in the U.S. topped 900, with more than 60,000 infections.New York State alone accounted for more than 30,000 cases and close to 300 deaths, most of them in New York City.Gov. Andrew Cuomo, again pleading for help in dealing with the onslaught, attributed the cluster to the city\\x92s role as a gateway to international travelers and the sheer density of its population, with 8.6 million people sharing subways, elevators, apartment buildings and offices.\\x93Our closeness makes us vulnerable,\\x94 he said. \\x93But it\\x92s true that your greatest weakness is also your greatest strength. And our closeness is what makes us who we are. That is what New York is.\\x94Some public health experts also attributed the city\\x92s burgeoning caseload in part to the state\\x92s big push to test people.Troy Tassier, a Fordham University professor who studies economic epidemiology, suggested the increase shows New York would have fared better had it acted sooner to order social distancing.Nearly 7 million people in the San Francisco area were all but confined to their homes on March 17, and California put all 40 million of its residents under a near-lockdown three days later.The order to stay at home in New York State did not go into effect until Sunday evening, March 22, and New York City\\x92s 1.1 million-student school system was not closed until March 15, well after other districts had shut down.Dr. Mark Dworkin, an epidemiology professor at University of Illinois-Chicago, said he hadn\\x92t followed New York\\x92s situation closely enough to say whether he would have done it differently, but he noted that moving quickly is critical -- and sometimes difficult to do at early points, when the public doesn\\x92t sense an imminent threat.\\x93At first, I think there\\x92s a certain amount of disbelief that goes on,\\x94 he said. \\x93I think that contributes, to some extent, to the lack of putting the foot on the gas pedal on some of the control measures that we know we need to do.\\x94After New York\\x92s first positive test came back on March 1 \\x97 in a health care worker who had traveled to Iran and secluded herself upon returning \\x97 Mayor Bill de Blasio and Cuomo initially cast the disease as a dangerous threat but one that the city\\x92s muscular hospital system could handle.The risk to most New Yorkers, they said, was relatively low.But their message shifted, as it did with many other leaders, who found themselves acting on new information in an uncharted, fast-changing situation.Tassier said it wasn\\x92t too late: \\x93We can still make things better than they would be otherwise.\\x94In a measure of how the virus is permeating life in ways big and small, the mayor said authorities would remove basketball hoops at 80 public courts where people were not respecting social-distancing instructions not to shoot around with anyone outside their households, while leaving up roughly 1,700 others where there were no problems.Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House\\x92s coronavirus task force, said at a briefing that the number of new cases in New York City has been relatively constant over the last three days.But she warned hospital cases will continue to increase because they reflect people who contracted the illness before full mitigation efforts kicked in, and urged city residents to follow White House recommendations.\\x93To every American out there, where you are protecting yourself, you are protecting others,\\x94 Birx said.In other developments around the globe:\\x97 The White House and legislative leaders hit last-minute snags after reaching agreement on a mammoth economic relief package, a $2 trillion plan to help businesses survive the crisis and give households checks of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child.

The Parliament\\x92s vote will let the government extend strict stay-at-home rules and business closings until April 11.\\x97 China\\x92s Hubei province, where the outbreak first emerged late last year, started lifting its lockdown. Authorities reported 67 new cases in the country, all imported in recent arrivals from abroad, and once again there were no new cases reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei.\\x97 Russian President Vladimir Putin postponed a nationwide vote on proposed constitutional amendments that could enable him to extend his hold on power. The decision came as Russia reported its first deaths from the virus, two elderly patients who had underlying conditions.\\x97 The French Riviera city of Cannes opened the site of its world-famous film festival to the homeless.\\x97 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said more than 400,000 people responded within a day to the government\\x92s call for volunteers to help the country\\x92s most vulnerable people. They will deliver medicine, drive people home from doctor\\x92s appointments and make phone calls to check on patients.\\x97 The Pentagon halted for 60 days the movement of U.S. troops and Defense Department civilians overseas, a measure expected to affect about 90,000 troops scheduled to deploy or return from abroad. A Marine became the first person stationed at the Pentagon to test positive for the virus.Around the U.S., other states braced for a version of New York\\x92s nightmare, with fears over public events held in the weeks before the virus exploded.A month after Mardi Gras in and around New Orleans, Louisiana is seeing a ballooning number of cases and now has the third-highest rate per capita in the U.S., according to the governor. Sixty-five have died, and the virus has been confirmed in three-quarters of the state\\x92s 64 parishes.Small towns and rural areas are beginning to sound the alarm as well.In Georgia, a state that has seen cases grow to more than 1,200, an Albany hospital\\x92s three intensive care units were already full, and doctors were working to discharge people as quickly as possible to make way for new patients.\\x93We\\x92re quickly approaching the point of maximum capacity.

Well, let me reciprocate. The US withdrawal from the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty in 2002 wasn\\'t predictable,\" Putin told journalists.As for human rights issues, Putin cited the Black Lives Matter movement in America, the US attacks in Afghanistan, and the existence of the Guantanamo Bay prison.\"One single strike can kill-(about) 120 people.

He also drilled holes and bolted a metal bar to try to prevent the opening of an emergency exit stairwell door near the door of his room.Lombardo again expressed frustration with the pace of the investigation, but not with the investigators who have yet to pinpoint the motive behind the shooter\\'s decision to fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel casino on a Las Vegas Strip concert crowd of 22,000 on October 1.\"It\\'s because this individual purposely hid his actions leading up to this event, and it is difficult for us to find the answers to those actions,\" Lombardo said. \"We believe he decided to take the lives he did and he had a very purposeful plan that he carried out.\"There is still no evidence Paddock was motivated by ideology, or that there was another shooter, he said. Investigators have found 200 incidents of Paddock moving through the city, and at no time was he with anyone else, Lombardo said.Lombardo said police and FBI agents, including behavioral profilers, still haven\\'t found a particular event in Paddock\\'s life that might have triggered the shooting. The sheriff added that a complete evaluation of Paddock\\'s mental condition was not yet done. Authorities didn\\'t find a note in his room, only a paper with numbers, he said.Investigators believe the numbers represented calculations for more precise shots, according to a law enforcement official who wasn\\'t authorized to discuss the details of the ongoing investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.The sheriff also confirmed investigators are talking with Paddock\\'s brother Eric Paddock, who traveled to Las Vegas, and continue to speak with the shooter\\'s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, to get insight.Lombardo declined to reveal what they\\'ve said, but he stated, \"Every piece of information we get is one more piece of the puzzle.\"Eric Paddock said he came to Las Vegas to retrieve his brother\\'s body in hopes of sending the cremated ashes to their 89-year-old mother in Orlando.Clark County Coroner John Fudenberg said Monday he could not discuss the results of an autopsy done on Stephen Paddock, who police said shot himself dead before officers arrived at the Las Vegas Strip hotel suite from which he rained gunfire on a concert crowd below.Eric Paddock told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that he plans to put his brother\\'s assets in a trust that would benefit the shooting victims.Law enforcement interviews with Paddock\\'s brother Saturday and Sunday were part of an exhaustive search through the 64-year-old\\'s life.Meanwhile, friends and relatives of the victims and other concert-goers who survived returned Monday to reclaim baby strollers, shoes, phones, backpacks and purses left behind in the panic as they fled.The personal effects being recovered were strewn across the massive grassy concert venue where 22,000 country music fans attended the Route 91 Harvest festival have become sentimental memories of loved ones for some and haunting reminders of the night of terror for others.People left behind thousands of items, Clark County Emergency Manager John Steinbeck said.Those who were in two areas of the concert grounds were being allowed to retrieve their things in groups, with authorities expanding the offer Monday to include people who were seated west of the stage. Authorities are powering up cellphones and asking people to text their full names to the phones to ensure they are returned to the correct owners.At the assistance center set up at a convention center in Las Vegas, a steady stream of individuals walked in on Monday looking for purses, wallets, cellphones and even a wedding bracelet. Volunteers filled out intake forms with detailed descriptions of their lost items, and later, FBI victims assistance agents asked for additional questions.People received their belongings in re-sealable plastic bags and were asked to check them.

It has devastated the oil industry in the U.S., which now pumps more crude than any other country.But some producers have been reluctant to ease supply. The cartel and other nations on Sunday agreed to allow Mexico to cut only 100,000 barrels a month, a sticking point for an accord initially reached Friday after a marathon video conference between 23 nations. The nations together agreed to cut 9.7 million barrels a day throughout May and June.The group reached the deal just hours before Asian markets reopened Monday and as international benchmark Brent crude traded at just over $31 a barrel and American shale producers struggle.Video aired by the Saudi-owned satellite channel Al-Arabiya showed the moment that Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, a son of King Salman, assented to the deal.\\x93I go with the consent, so I agree,\\x94 the prince said, chuckling, drawing a round of applause from those on the video call.But it had not been smiles and laughs for weeks after the so-called OPEC+ group of OPEC members and other nations failed in March to reach an agreement on production cuts, sending prices tumbling. Saudi Arabia sharply criticized Russia days earlier over what it described as comments critical of the kingdom, which finds itself trying to appease Trump, a longtime OPEC critic.Even U.S. senators had warned Saudi Arabia to find a way to boost prices as American shale firms face far-higher production costs. American troops had been deployed to the kingdom for the first time since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks over concerns of Iranian retaliation amid regional tensions.\\x93They\\x92ve spent over the last month waging war on American oil producers while we are defending theirs. This is not how friends treat friends,\\x94 said Sen. Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, before the OPEC+ deal.U.S. producers have already been reducing output. The American Petroleum Institute lauded Sunday\\x92s global pact, saying it will help get other nations\\x92 state-owned oil production to follow the lead of U.S. producers that are trying to adjust to plunging demand.Brouillette said the U.S. did not make commitments of its own production cuts, but was able to show the obvious \\x97 that plunging demand because of the pandemic is expected to slash U.S. oil production.Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh also told state television that Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates would cut another 2 million barrels of oil a day between them atop the OPEC+ deal. The three countries did not immediately acknowledge the cut themselves, though Zanganeh attended the video conference.Officials said other planned cuts would stand in the deal, meaning an 8 million barrel per day cut from July through the end of the year and a 6 million barrel cut for 16 months beginning in 2021.\\x93This will enable the rebalancing of the oil markets and the expected rebound of prices by $15 per barrel in the short term,\\x94 said a statement from Nigeria\\x92s oil ministry.Mexico had initially blocked the deal but its president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, had said Friday that he had agreed with Trump that the U.S. will compensate what Mexico cannot add to the proposed cuts.\\x93The big Oil Deal with OPEC Plus is done. This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States,\\x94 Trump said in a tweet. \\x93I would like to thank and congratulate President Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia.\\x94The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin held a joint call with Trump and Saudi King Salman to express support of the deal. It also said Putin spoke separately with Trump about the oil market and other issues.Analysts offered cautious praise.\\x93The pure size of the cut is unprecedented, but, then again, so is the impact the coronavirus is having on demand,\\x94 said Mohammed Ghulam, an energy analyst at Raymond James.But Ghulam and others worried it may not be enough.\\x93This is at least a temporary relief for the energy industry and for the global economy.

Moreover, around 25 per cent of all meat produced, equivalent to 75 million cows, goes uneaten.\"To tackle all forms of malnutrition and promote healthy diets, we need to put in place food systems that increase the availability, affordability and consumption of fresh, nutrient-rich food for everyone,\" FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva said.Reducing food loss and waste, particularly high-nutrient foods, not only has nutritional benefits, but also contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and should be a new priority for improving nutrition.\"Taking specific actions to reduce the losses and waste of fresh and nutritious food is a fundamental part of this effort,\" said da Silva, who is also a member of the Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition, joint report author.The report proposes a series of policy actions across the entire food system, including educating all concerned; focusing on perishable foods; improving public and private infrastructure; and closing data gaps on food losses and waste.FAO data indicates that in low-income countries, food is mostly lost during harvesting, storage, processing and transportation; while in high-income nations the problem lies in retail and consumer level waste. Together, they directly impact the number of calories and nutrients actually available for consumption.Given the direct impact on wellbeing, learning capacity and productivity, the loss and waste of micronutrients is of particular concern.Globally, agriculture produces 22 per cent more vitamin A than we require. However, after loss and waste, the amount available for human consumption is 11 per cent less than required. Reducing the loss and waste of nutritious foods could therefore yield substantial health benefits.With the value of global food lost or wasted annually, estimated to be around $1 trillion, cutting down on waste would also yield major economic benefits. Additionally, eating more of the food already produced, would avoid wasting the water, land and energy that went into its production, said FAO.\\xa0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

Explained', 'China has publicly said that it plans to merge Taiwan to the mainland even if it has to annex it militarily.', 'In this photo released by the Taiwan Presidential Office, a military jet taxis along a highway in Jiadong, Taiwan, Wednesday, Sept. 15, 2021Between Friday and Monday, a total of 145 Chinese air force planes flew into Taiwan\\'s air defence identification zone (ADIZ) in a flagrant violation of its sovereignty.China has been regularly, and increasingly, trespassing into Taiwan\\'s marine and air spaces over the last two years. It has been intimidating its eastern democratic neighbour in the hope of annexing it into the mainland one day. But the 145 aircraft over four days was setting a new record of intimidation.In response, Taiwan\\'s Ministry of National Defence (MND) scrambled combat patrol aircraft and issued radio warnings to the Chinese aircraft. It also alerted its air defence missile systems to monitor Chinese fighters.October 1 is Chinese national day while October 10 is Taiwanese National Day--anathema to Beijing as it cuts at the heart of its One China Policy (OCP).The Chinese air force, known as the PLA Air Force (PLAAF) flew 38 planes on Friday--the Chinese National Day, followed by 39 on Saturday, 16 on Sunday and 52 on Monday into Taiwan\\'s ADIZ.China is not only testing the waters by flexing its muscles, it is also trying to demoralise Taiwan.According to China experts, Beijing is reacting to the increased, and successful, mobilisation by the US, Japan, Taiwan, Australia in the Indo-Pacific in response to China\\'s aggression against its neighbours and also the South China Sea (SCS).The recent AUKUS (Australia, the UK and the US) military pact on equipping Australia with nuclear-power submarines to take on China has also rattled the latter.The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) quotes Wen-Ti Sung, an expert on China\\'s foreign policy at the Australian National University, as saying that Beijing\\'s show of force against Taiwan was for international and domestic audiences. Sung said: \"It (AUKUS) is a big deal that signals Australia\\'s greater willingness to be engaged with security [issues] in Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. It will be increasing deterrence against China, and China does not look upon [that] very favourably.\"China has publicly said that it plans to merge Taiwan to the mainland even if it has to annex it militarily. On the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on July 1, 2021, President Xi Jinping had said: \"No one should underestimate the resolve, the will and ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" in reference to Taiwan.The US took note of the air space harassment. In a statement Washington said: \"The United States is very concerned by the People\\'s Republic of China\\'s provocative military activity near Taiwan, which is destabilizing, risks miscalculations, and undermines regional peace and stability. We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure and coercion against Taiwan.\"The US, which is a strong ally to a democratic Taiwan, reinforced that it will \"continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability\". Washington added that American commitment to Taiwan is \"rock solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region\".', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

Many parents have been pushing for an expansion of shots to toddlers and preschoolers, especially as the omicron variant sent record numbers of youngsters to the hospital.\\x93I would say the parents in my office are desperate\\x94 to get young kids vaccinated, said Dr. Dyan Hes, who runs a pediatrics practice in New York City, where vaccination rates are high. For many, \\x93that\\x92s the first thing they ask when they walk through the door: \\x91When do you think the shot is going to come out?\\x92\\x94Pfizer aims to give children as young as 6 months shots that contain one-tenth of the dose given to adults. The company said it had started submitting its data to the FDA and expects to complete the process in a few days.An open question is how many shots those children will need. Two of the extra-low doses turned out to be strong enough for babies but not for preschoolers in early testing. Pfizer now is testing a third shot, data that\\x92s expected in late March.That means the FDA may consider whether to authorize two shots for now, with potentially a third shot being cleared later if the study supports it.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement that company scientists believe this age group ultimately will need three of the extra low-dose shots but that FDA action now could let parents begin the vaccination process while awaiting a final decision.The FDA said it will convene a panel of independent researchers and physicians in mid-February to help review the Pfizer data. The agency isn\\x92t required to follow their advice, but the input is a key step in publicly vetting vaccine safety and effectiveness.The question of how long to wait for new vaccine data \\x97 and how much to require \\x97 is a concern for FDA regulators, who face pressure to be more proactive against a virus that has repeatedly confounded health experts.The FDA asked Pfizer to begin submitting its application now due to omicron\\x92s \\x93greater toll on children,\\x94 an agency spokeswoman said, citing a peak in cases among children under 5.\\x93In light of these new data and the rise in illnesses and hospitalization in this youngest age group, FDA believed that it was prudent to request that Pfizer submit the data it had available,\\x94 agency spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo said in an emailed statement.The FDA\\x92s ultimate decision could come within the month, but that isn\\x92t the only hurdle. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has to sign off.The Biden administration has been trying to speed the authorization of COVID-19 shots for children, contending vaccinations are critical for opening schools and daycare centers and keeping them open, and for freeing up parents from child care duties so they can go back to work.Yet vaccination rates have been lower among children than in other age groups. As of last week, just 20% of kids ages 5 to 11 and just over half of 12- to 17-year-olds were fully vaccinated, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Nearly three-quarters of adults are fully vaccinated.Young children are far less likely than adults to get severely ill from the coronavirus, but it can happen, and pediatric COVID-19 infections are higher than at any other point in the pandemic.\\x93What we\\x92re seeing right now is still a lot of hospitalizations and unfortunately some deaths in this age group,\\x94 said Dr. Sean O\\x92Leary of the University of Colorado, who is on the AAP\\x92s infectious disease committee. If the FDA clears vaccinations for these youngsters, \\x93that\\x92s going to be really important because all of those hospitalizations and deaths essentially are preventable.\\x94For kids under 5, Pfizer\\x92s study is giving participants two shots three weeks apart, followed by a third dose at least two months later. The company is testing whether the youngsters produce antibody levels similar to those known to protect teens and young adults.In December, Pfizer announced that children under 2 looked to be protected but that the antibody response was too low in 2- to 4-year-olds. It\\x92s not clear why, but one possibility is that the extra-low dose was a little too low for the preschoolers.Since the preliminary results showed the shots were safe, Pfizer added a third dose to the testing in hopes of improving protection.A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found just 3 in 10 parents of children under 5 would get their youngster vaccinated as soon as shots were authorized, while about a quarter said they definitely would not. Results of the survey of 1,536 adults, conducted in mid-January, were released Tuesday.Chicago health officials have been trying to prepare parents for months for the day the shots are available, said Dr. Nimmi Rajagopal, a family medicine physician for Cook County Health, which oversees the public hospital system.

Gursharan was charged more than two years ago for the corruption cases.The bribe she received from Francis included SGD100,000 in cash for a condominium apartment down payment and a prudential policy apart from more than SGD30,000 worth of stays in luxury hotels like Ritz-Carlton in Bali and Dubai, as well as the Shangri-La Hotel in Jakarta.The scandal has also resulted in the arrest and conviction of several Navy officials in the US.Gursharan\\x92s lawyer Suresh Damodara pleaded for minimal punishment of her client, citing her illness. However, the Judge pointed out that Gursharan was not terminally ill currently and would be provided medical care while incarcerated.Francis, the CEO of GDMA also nicknamed Fat Leonard, is in custody in the US and faces a maximum custodial term of 25 years for defrauding the navy of more than USD 35 million.Twelve US Navy officials pleaded guilty in the US, while the highest-ranking official involved, Rear Admiral Robert Gilbeau, was sentenced to 18 months\\x92 jail for making false statements to investigators.(With PTI inputs)', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

And then we got hit by the China plague, which we\\'re not going to forget,\\x94 he said.\\x93So we closed it up. We closed it up and then we opened it up and we saved. I\\'ll tell you we saved 2 million lives. But what happened with that shouldn\\'t have been... we can never forget what China did to us, we can never forget,\\x94 Trump said.Trump has repeatedly blamed China for the coronavirus pandemic which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year and accused Beijing of suppressing the details of the contagion.The US is the worst-affected country from the virus with over 2,31,000 deaths and over 9 million infections.The pandemic devastated the country\\'s economy, resulting in the loss of millions of jobs.Throughout the day, Trump accused his Democratic challenger Joe Biden of being soft on China and alleged that Beijing wants Biden to win the November 3 presidential election.The president slammed his 77-year-old Democratic opponent calling him as one with low energy or \"sleepy\".\\x93They dream about \\'sleepy\\' Joe Biden.

I am the candidate of farmers, factory workers, police officers, and hard-working, law-abiding patriots of every race, religion and creed!\\x94 said the president.\\x93Biden will terminate school choice, eliminate charter schools, defund religious schools, ban prayer in public schools, indoctrinate your children with Anti-American lies, and force you to subsidize extreme late-term abortion. We believe that every child is a Sacred Gift from God!\\x94 he said.Trump alleged that for decades, \"Biden let other countries rip them off and cheat America blind.\"\\x93The only people who\\x92ve benefited from his policies are himself and his family.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)President Donald Trump on Friday labeled churches and other houses of worship as \\x93essential\\x94 and called on governors nationwide to let them reopen this weekend even though some areas remain under coronavirus lockdown. The president threatened to \\x93override\\x94 governors who defy him, but it was unclear what authority he has to do so.\\x93Governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now \\x97 for this weekend,\\x94 Trump said at a hastily arranged press conference at the White House. Asked what authority Trump might have to supersede governors, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said she wouldn\\x92t answer a theoretical question.Trump has been pushing for the country to reopen as he tries to reverse an economic free fall playing out months before he faces reelection. White evangelical Christians have been among the president\\x92s most loyal supporters, and the White House has been careful to attend to their concerns throughout the crisis.Following Trump\\x92s announcement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new guidelines for communities of faith on how to safely reopen, including recommendations to limit the size of gatherings and consider holding services outdoors or in large, well-ventilated areas.Public health agencies have generally advised people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people and encouraged Americans to remain 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from others when possible. Some parts of the country remain under some version of remain-at-home orders.In-person religious services have been vectors for transmission of the virus. A person who attended a Mother\\x92s Day service at a church in Northern California that defied the governor\\x92s closure orders later tested positive, exposing more than 180 churchgoers. And a choir practice at a church in Washington state was labeled by the CDC as an early \\x93superspreading\\x94 event.But Trump on Friday stressed the importance of churches in many communities and said he was \\x93identifying houses of worship \\x97 churches, synagogues and mosques \\x97 as essential places that provide essential services.\\x94\\x93Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential\\x94 but not churches, he said. \\x93It\\x92s not right. So I\\x92m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential.\\x94\\x93These are places that hold our society together and keep our people united,\\x94 he added.Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said faith leaders should be in touch with local health departments and can take steps to mitigate risks, including making sure those who are at high risk of severe complications remain protected.\\x93There\\x92s a way for us to work together to have social distancing and safety for people so we decrease the amount of exposure that anyone would have to an asymptomatic,\\x94 she said.A person familiar with the White House\\x92s thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations said Trump had called the news conference, which had not been on his public schedule, because he wanted to be the face of church reopenings, knowing how well it would play with his political base.Churches around the country have filed legal challenges opposing virus closures. In Minnesota, after Democratic Gov. Tim Walz this week declined to lift restrictions on churches, Roman Catholic and some Lutheran leaders said they would defy his ban and resume worship services. They called the restrictions unconstitutional and unfair since restaurants, malls and bars were allowed limited reopening.Some hailed the president\\x92s move, including Kelly Shackelford, president of the conservative First Liberty Institute.\\x93The discrimination that has been occurring against churches and houses of worship has been shocking,\\x94 he said in a statement. \\x93Americans are going to malls and restaurants. They need to be able to go to their houses of worship.\\x94But Rabbi Jack Moline, president of Interfaith Alliance, said it was \\x93completely irresponsible\\x94 for Trump to call for a mass reopening of houses of worship.\\x93Faith is essential and community is necessary; however, neither requires endangering the people who seek to participate in them,\\x94 he said. \\x93The virus does not discriminate between types of gatherings, and neither should the president.\\x94Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, made clear that churches and other houses of worship will not resume in-person services in her state until at least next weekend and said she was skeptical Trump had the authority to impose such a requirement.\\x93It\\x92s reckless to force them to reopen this weekend. They\\x92re not ready,\\x94 she said. \\x93We\\x92ve got a good plan. I\\x92m going to stick with it.\\x94New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, said he would review the federal guidance, while maintaining a decision rests with him.\\x93Obviously we\\x92d love to get to the point where we can get those open, but we\\x92ll look at the guidance documents and try to make some decisions rather quickly, depending on what it might say,\\x94 he said. \\x93It\\x92s the governor\\x92s decision, of course.\\x94The CDC more than a month ago sent the Trump administration documents the agency had drafted outlining specific steps various kinds of organizations, including houses of worship, could follow as they worked to reopen safely. But the White House dragged its feet, concerned that the recommendations were too specific and could give the impression the administration was interfering in church operations.The guidance posted Friday contains most of the same advice as the draft guidance. It calls for the use of face coverings and recommends keeping worshippers 6 feet from one another and cutting down on singing, which can spread aerosolized drops that carry the virus. But there are some differences.The draft guidance discussed reopening in steps. A first phase would have limited gatherings to video streaming and drive-in services. Later phases allow in-person gatherings of limited size and only when social distancing precautions could be followed. The new guidance has no discussion of such phases.Another difference: The draft guidance said everyone who attends a service should wear a face covering, while the new guidance says masks should be used when social distancing cannot be maintained.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

      "['Russia-Ukraine war: US, EU, UK to sanction Russian central bank, block SWIFT', \"Saturday's move includes cutting key Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial messaging system, which daily moves countless billions of dollars around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions around the world.\", 'Ukrainian refugees walk along vehicles lining-up to cross the border from Ukraine into Moldova, at Mayaky-Udobne crossing border point near UdobneThe United States, European Union and the United Kingdom agreed to put in place crippling sanctions on the Russian financial sector, including a block on its access to the global financial system and, for the first time, restrictions on its central bank in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine. The measures were announced jointly on Saturday as part of a new round of financial sanctions meant to \"hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.\"\\xa0The central bank restrictions target the more than USD 600 billion in reserves that the Kremlin has at its disposal, meant to limit Russia\\'s ability to support the ruble amid tightening Western sanctions.Cumulatively the steps announced by the West since Russia began the invasion would potentially amount to some of the toughest sanctions on any country in modern times, and if fully carried out as planned, would severely damage the Russian economy and markedly constrain its ability to import and export goods.US officials said Saturday\\'s steps were framed to send the ruble into \"free fall\" and promote soaring inflation in the Russian economy. They noted that previously announced sanctions have already had an impact on Russia, bringing its currency to its lowest level against the dollar in history and giving its stock market the worst week on record.Saturday\\'s move includes cutting key Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial messaging system, which daily moves countless billions of dollars around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions around the world.The fine print of the sanctions was still being ironed out over the weekend, officials said, as they work to limit the impact of the restrictions on other economies and European purchases of Russian energy.Allies on both sides of the Atlantic also considered the SWIFT option in 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed Ukraine\\'s Crimea and backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. Russia declared then that kicking it out of SWIFT would be equivalent to a declaration of war.\\xa0The allies \\x97 criticised ever after for responding too weakly to Russia\\'s 2014 aggression \\x97 shelved the idea. Russia since then has tried to develop its own financial transfer system, with limited success.The US has succeeded before in persuading the Belgium-based SWIFT system to kick out a country \\x97 Iran, over its nuclear program. But kicking Russia out of SWIFT could also hurt other economies, including those of the US and key ally Germany.The disconnection from SWIFT announced by the West on Saturday is partial, leaving Europe and the United States room to escalate penalties further later.Announcing the measures in Brussels, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said would push the bloc also to \"paralyse the assets of Russia\\'s Central bank\" so that its transactions would be frozen. Cutting several commercial banks from SWIFT \"will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally,\" she added.\"Cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block Russian exports and imports,\" she added.\\xa0\"Putin embarked on a path aiming to destroy Ukraine, but what he is also doing, in fact, is destroying the future of his own country.\"Getting the EU on board for sanctioning Russia through SWIFT had been a tough process since EU trade with Russia amounted to 80 billion euros, about 10 times as much as the United States, which had been an early proponent of such measures.Germany specifically had balked at the measure since it could hit them hard. But Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement that \"after Russia\\'s shameless attack... we are working hard on limiting the collateral damage of decoupling (Russia) from SWIFT so that it hits the right people. What we need is a targeted, functional restrictions of SWIFT.\"As another measure, the allies announced a commitment \"to taking measures to limit the sale of citizenship \\x97 so-called golden passports \\x97 that let wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems.\"The group also announced the formation this week of a transatlantic task force to ensure that these and other sanctions on Russia are implemented effectively through information sharing and asset freezes.\"These new sanctions, which include removing several Russian banks from SWIFT and sanctioning Russia\\'s central bank, are likely to cause serious damage to the Russian economy and its banking system,\" said Clay Lowery, executive vice president of the Institute of International Finance.\\xa0\"While details on how the new sanctions affect energy are still emerging, we do know that sanctions on its central bank will make it more difficult for Russia to export energy and other commodities.\"Rachel Ziemba, an adjunct senior fellow at the Centre for a New American Security said despite a complete SWIFT ban, \"these measures will still be painful to Russia\\'s economy. They reinforce the measures already taken earlier this week by making transactions more complicated and difficult.\"Ziemba says how much pain the sanctions render on the Russian economy will depend on which banks have been restricted and which measures are taken to restrict the ability of the Central Bank to operate.(With inputs from AP)Also Read |\\xa0Attempting to stop invasion by Russian tanks, Ukrainian soldier blows himself up', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

The election is to be held Oct. 22.Support ratings for Abe\\'s government have started to rebound after attacks on him over cronyism scandals faded during the recess. Also, opposition parties are regrouping and unprepared for an election. Opposition lawmakers have said there is no need to hold an election now.Abe said he was seeking a mandate for his plans to use new tax revenues for education and elderly care, and for his defense policy toward North Korea\\'s escalating missile and nuclear threat, saying the situation is tantamount to a national crisis.\"I will tackle the national crisis with my strong leadership,\" Abe said.\"I expect opposition criticism is going to focus on (the scandals), and it\\'s going to be a very difficult election,\" Abe said. He said he will step down as prime minister if his Liberal Democratic Party fails to win a majority, or at least 233 seats, to stay in power.Analysts believe his ruling Liberal Democratic Party will retain a majority, but could lose the two-thirds majority it currently holds with its coalition partner, the Komei party. Still, a big enough victory could help Abe extend his hold on power. His three-year term as party leader ends next September, and he will have to fend off any challengers from within the LDP to remain prime minister.\"For Mr. Abe, now is the time. He is taking advantage of unprepared opposition parties as he seeks to prolong his leadership,\" said Yu Uchiyama, a University of Tokyo politics professor.Support ratings for his government plunged to below 30 percent in July following repeated parliamentary questions about allegations that Abe helped his friend obtain approval for a veterinary college.Recent media polls show the support ratings recovering to around 50 percent, helped by parliament\\'s recess and a Cabinet reshuffle in August that removed the defense minister and several other unpopular ministers. A Nikkei newspaper survey published Monday showed that 44 percent of respondents said they would vote for Abe\\'s party in the election, followed by just 8 percent for two opposition parties.It\\'s a significant turnaround from June, when the Liberal Democratic Party suffered a devastating loss in a Tokyo city assembly election to maverick Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike\\'s new regional party.Opposition lawmakers are scrambling to regroup.Earlier Monday, Koike announced the launch of a new national party that she will head, though she will remain as governor to focus on hosting the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and other issues.She said her Hope Party will be conservative and push for transparency in government, women\\'s advancement, elimination of nuclear energy and other reforms. Several parliamentarians, including defectors from the main opposition Democratic Party, have announced their intention to join her party.\"This is going to be a new force formed by members aiming to achieve reforms and conservativism,\" Koike said. \"We are going to create a Japan where there is hope for everyone that tomorrow will certainly be better than today.\"The Democrats, which held power in 2009-2012, have lost ground largely due to internal disagreements.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

Some said that Pakistan being a Muslim nation was yet to issue identity cards to Afghan refugees and doing so for a Chinese national made their intentions suspect and morally wrong.The reactions seen on social media by Pakistanis in many ways image the apprehensions many in the country hold over the $60 billion CPEC, a part of Chinese President Xi Jinping\\x92s pet Belt and Road initiative.The CPEC, connecting Pakistan's deep-water port Gwadar and China's Xinjiang, has been presented as a lifeline for Pakistan\\x92s ailing economy, with the 3,000-km project promising to create jobs and vital infrastructure as well as boost local industry.Still, Pakistanis are divided over its benefits to the country, with several economists pointing out to the fact that it was China that stood to benefit instead.

And it will require increased investment to make U.S. forces more lethal, agile and ready for war.', \"Countering China\\x92s rapidly expanding military and an increasingly aggressive Russia are now the U.S. military\\x92s top national security priorities, outpacing the threat of terrorism, the Pentagon said Friday.A new national defense strategy says that competition with China and Russia has threatened America\\x92s military advantage around the world. And it will require increased investment to make U.S. forces more lethal, agile and ready for war.\\x93We will continue to prosecute the campaign against terrorists, but great power competition -- not terrorism -- is now the primary focus of U.S. national security,\\x94 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in prepared remarks at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.He declared the defeat of the Islamic State group\\x92s \\x93physical caliphate\\x94 in Iraq and Syria, but warned that IS, al-Qaida and other extremists continue as threats across the globe.The document reflects persistent U.S. worries about China\\x92s military build-up in the South China Sea, its moves to expand its political and economic influence around the globe, and what has long been described as Beijing\\x92s systematic campaign of cyberattacks and data theft from government agencies and private U.S. corporations.And it underscores American concerns about Russia\\x92s aggressive military moves, including the invasion of Ukraine and involvement in the Syria war, as well as its meddling in the 2016 election.Pentagon officials released an 11-page unclassified version of the strategy on Friday, saying it mapped out a \\x93fundamental shift\\x94 in focus for the military.\\x93We\\x92ve been doing a lot of things in the last 25 years, and we\\x92ve been focused on really other problems and this strategy really represents a fundamental shift to say, look, we have to get back, in a sense, to basics of the potential for war,\\x94 said Elbridge Colby, the deputy assistant defense secretary for strategy. \\x93This strategy says the focus will be on prioritizing preparedness for war and particularly major power war.\\x94Previous defense chiefs have long warned about a rising China -- triggering the Obama administration\\x92s move to put a greater focus on the Asia Pacific region, including added ships and troops. And the new strategy\\x92s call for strengthening alliances sounds more like previous administrations, rather than the \\x93America First\\x94 message of President Donald Trump\\x92s national security strategy that was released in December.The Pentagon document says that allies and partners are crucial and can provide additional capabilities and access to other regions.\\x93This is not 1999, when some would say the U.S. can do everything by itself,\\x94 said Colby. \\x93There is a practical reality that we need to be able to do things together, to be more interoperable, to be able to divide up missions in a constructive way.\\x94Asked if terrorism is no longer a top priority, Colby said it remains a \\x93serious, pressing threat\\x94, and that Iran and North Korea are \\x93urgent problems.\\x94 But, he said that the central challenge for the U.S. military is \\x93the erosion of U.S. military advantage vis-a-vis China and Russia, which unaddressed could ultimately undermine our ability to deter aggression and coercion.\\x94Colby, however, added that the U.S. continues to seek areas of cooperation with Russia and China, saying that \\x93this is not a strategy of confrontation.'The U.S. has been urging China to take a more active role in convincing North Korea to set aside its nuclear ambitions, and the U.S. has held talks with Russia to ensure there are no conflicts or accidents in the skies over Syria, where both nations are flying in the war against the Islamic State group.In the strategy\\x92s conclusion, Mattis makes clear that his goal is to \\x93pursue change at significant scale\\x94 with sustained investment and creative approaches. That plan, however, will face grim budget hurdles.Congress has been deadlocked and unable to pass a spending bill, bringing the federal government once again to the brink of a shutdown at midnight Friday. And lawmakers are still constrained by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which put mandatory spending caps in place.The Pentagon strategy acknowledges the budget limits, and calls for greater spending discipline and management, as well as a commitment to again seek more base closings to save money. Congress has repeatedly rejected additional base closings.The new plan cannot survive, Mattis said, without needed and stable funding.\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

In 2017, the sale of US weapons to other countries was USD 41.9 billion.', \"India's weapons procurement from US jumps to USD 3.4 billion in 2020India's weapons procurement from the United States jumped from meagre USD 6.2 million to a whopping USD 3.4-billion in the final year of the Donald Trump administration, according to official data. The jump in the sale of American weapons to India comes at a time when the sale of weapons from the US to other countries has dipped to USD 50.8 billion in 2020 from USD 55.7 billion in 2019.In 2019, the sale of US weapons to foreign countries was USD 55.7 billion, according to data from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). In 2017, the sale of US weapons to other countries was USD 41.9 billion.According to the statistics released by the DSCA, major buyers of American weapons in 2020 were India (USD 3.4 billion up from USD 6.2 million in fiscal year 2019), Morocco (USD 4.5 billion up from USD 12.4 million), Poland (USD 4.7 billion up from USD 673 million), Singapore (USD 1.3 billion up from USD 137 million), Taiwan (USD 11.8 billion up from USD 876 million), and the United Arab Emirates (USD 3.6 billion up from USD 1.1 billion).Several countries reported a drop in the purchase of weapons from the US.Prominent among them were Saudi Arabia which came down from USD 14.9 billion in 2019 to USD 1.2 billion in 2020, Afghanistan (USD 1.1 billion down from USD 1.6 billion), Belgium (USD 41.8 million down from USD 5.5 billion), Iraq (USD 368 million down from USD 1.4 billion), and South Korea (USD 2.1 billion down from USD 2.7 billion).According to the 2020 edition of the Historical Sales Book, India purchased weapons worth USD 754.4 million in 2017 and USD 282 million in 2018. Between 1950 and 2020, the US sale of weapons to India under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) category was USD 12.8 billion.For Pakistan, the official figures reflected that the sale of weapons under FMS did happen, even though there was a freeze in any military and security assistance to Islamabad from the Trump Administration.In 2020, the US sale of weapons to Pakistan was USD 146 million, in 2018 it was USD 65 million and in 2017 it was USD 22 million.In 2019, there was no sale of US military weapons to Pakistan. In fact, the US refunded USD 10.8 million to Pakistan, taken for the purchase of weapons.Between 1950 and 2020, Pakistan purchased weapons worth USD 10 billion from the US under FMS.However, the total supply of American military weapons to Pakistan is much more, as a major chunk of weapons to Pakistan has gone from the United States as military and security assistance.According to the Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs Clarke Cooper, fiscal 2020 saw a total of USD 175.8 billion in US government-authorized arms exports. This is overall a 2.8 per cent increase since the fiscal year 2019.The overall value of State Department-authorised government-to-government FMS cases implemented by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency decreased 8.3 per cent from USD55.39 billion in Fiscal Year 2019 to USD50.78 billion in the Fiscal Year 2020.\\x93The dollar value of potential FMS sales formally notified to Congress, also rose by more than 50 per cent from USD 58.33 billion to USD 87.64 billion. This was driven by the July potential sale of USD 23.11 billion worth of F-35 aircraft to Japan, which was the second-largest single FMS notification ever authorised by the Department of State,\\x94 Cooper said.The Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), which is the Department of State-authorised commercial export licenses, totalled USD124.3 billion in the fiscal year 2020, and this was up from USD114.7 billion in fiscal year 2019, he said.\\x93This represented an 8.4 per cent increase. This total value covers authorisations of hardware, defense services, and technical data. The total number of licences issued decreased by 20-per cent from 36,111 in Fiscal Year 2019 to 28,800 in the Fiscal Year 2020,\\x94 Cooper said.The top commercial DCS notified to Congress in Fiscal Year 2020 included a USD 8.39 billion sale to Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom for F-35 components.This also included a USD 3.2 billion sale to Australia for P-8 aircraft parts, and a USD 2.48 billion sale to the United Kingdom and Australia for E-7 airborne early warning and control aircraft, Cooper said.\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

Standing before survivors of the 1945 U.S. atomic bombings, Francis denounced the steady erosion of arms control agreements and rejected the Cold War-era doctrine of deterrence that had been sanctioned by the Catholic Church for nearly three decades.In the rain of Nagasaki and the silent darkness of Hiroshima, he urged political leaders to accept that true peace and international security cannot be built in a climate of distrust, but rather solidarity.\\x93The use of atomic energy for purposes of war is immoral,\\x94 the pope declared during a nighttime prayer at Hiroshima\\x92s peace memorial. He added off-the-cuff, \\x93As is the possession of atomic weapons.\\x94\\x93We will be judged for this,\\x94 he warned.Francis visited Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the first full day of a three-day trip to Japan aimed at emphasizing his call for a global ban on atomic weapons. Nagasaki was the perfect place to begin, the birthplace of Christianity in Japan where he could honour innocents killed in war as well as Christian missionaries and martyrs killed for their faith.The mood there was sombre, darkened by the downpour that drenched the terraced fields and rice paddies and the hundreds of Japanese who came out in plastic raincoats to witness the second pope pay his respects after St. John Paul II in 1981.The scene was equally as restrained in Hiroshima, where a brief round of applause when Francis arrived punctured an otherwise quiet night. After a gong signalled a moment of silence and Francis lit a candle of peace, two survivors offered their testimony about the \\x93demonic\\x94 atom bomb.\\x93No one in this world can imagine such a scene of hell,\\x94 said Yoshiko Kajimoto, who was 14 at the time and was working in a factory 2.3 kilometers (1.4 miles) north of ground zero when the blue light of the bomb tore through the windows, collapsing the building on top of her.Standing solemnly before Francis, she described what she saw along the evacuation route:\\x93There were more and more people coming by. Their bodies were so burned and totally red. Their faces were swollen to double size, their lips hanging loose, with both hands held out with burnt skin hanging from them. They no longer looked human.\\x94Kajimoto had two-thirds of her stomach removed in 1999 because of cancer and now suffers from leukaemia. \\x93I work hard to bear witness that we must not use such demonic atomic bombs again, nor let anyone in the world endure such suffering,\\x94 she said.\\x93Do we still need nuclear even after you see all of this?\\x94 she asked. \\x93Each one of us can only do so much.\\x94Her testimony clearly had an impact on Francis, whose own emotional reaction to images of the Nagasaki aftermath prompted him last year to print up thousands of pocket-sized copies of a photograph of a young Nagasaki boy carrying his dead brother on his back that was taken by American military photographer Joe O\\x92Donnel.Francis had the words \\x93The fruit of war\\x94 printed on the image, and a poster-sized copy was on display in Nagasaki, where Francis met with the photographer\\x92s son, Tyge, an invited guest.The Holy See was among the first countries to sign and ratify the new U.N. nuclear prohibition treaty, and Francis himself went further than any pope before him in saying in 2017 that not only the use but the mere possession of atomic weapons is \\x93to be condemned.\\x94Up until Francis\\x92 2017 condemnation, the Catholic Church had held that nuclear deterrence could be morally acceptable in the interim as long as it was used toward mutual, verifiable nuclear disarmament. The Holy See, however, has seen that the deterrence doctrine has essentially resulted in a nuclear status quo, with arms control treaties collapsing.\\x93Many liberals applauded and conservatives criticized the 2017 statement because they saw it as abandoning the prior teaching that deterrence can be morally acceptable if used as a step toward disarmament,\\x94 said Gerard Powers, director of the Catholic Peacebuilding Network at the University of Notre Dame\\x92s Kroc Institute.He said he viewed Francis\\x92 2017 statement as a \\x93prudential moral judgment based on his reading of the nuclear signs of the time.\\x94Francis essentially repeated his 2017 position in Hiroshima, saying the possession of nuclear weapons too was \\x93immoral.\\x94Tomohide Hirayama, a former Nagasaki resident who travelled from another prefecture to see the pope, said his religious faith was different but he fully supported Francis\\x92 call for a nuclear-free world.\\x93There were atomic attacks twice in history, and there should never be a third time,\\x94 he said. \\x93I feel that strongly, and isn\\x92t that what the pope is saying?\\x94The first U.S. atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, killing 140,000 people. The second one dropped three days later on Nagasaki and killed another 74,000 by the end of the same year. Many of the survivors have suffered the lasting impact of radiation and developed various forms of cancer.\\x93In a world where millions of children and families live in inhumane conditions, the money that is squandered and the fortunes made through the manufacture, upgrading, maintenance and sale of ever more destructive weapons are an affront crying out to heaven,\\x94 Francis said.He lamented the \\x93climate of distrust\\x94 that is eating away at nonproliferation efforts and the arms control framework, a reference to a series of violated treaties and the demise this year of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, a landmark Cold War-era arms control agreement. The U.S. formally withdrew from the treaty in August, after accusing Moscow of developing a Russian missile system prohibited under it.Japanese who came out to see Francis were grateful for his message and his pilgrimage.\\x93I think he is a person who can deliver the message of peace without inhibition,\\x94 said Fumiyo Negoro, a 62-year-old Christian from Osaka.Negoro waited for hours in the rain for Francis\\x92 Mass earlier Sunday, celebrated in Nagasaki\\x92s baseball stadium before a crowd of some 35,000 \\x97 and the remains of a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary rescued from a cathedral destroyed in the bombing.The statue, which was remarkably well preserved despite the blast, was featured on the altar.Francis\\x92 visit to Nagasaki also gave him the chance to honour Christian missionaries and martyrs centuries after St. Francis Xavier first brought Christianity to the Japanese archipelago in 1549.He laid the second wreath of flowers at the memorial of 26 Nagasaki Martyrs, who were crucified in 1597 at the start of the two-century wave of anti-Christian persecution by Japanese rulers.The example of the missionaries and martyrs and the Hidden Christians who kept their faith alive underground for generations helped inspire a young priest named Jorge Mario Bergolio to be a missionary in Japan.\\x93May we never forget their heroic sacrifice!\\x94 Francis said in remarks at the memorial.ALSO READ |\\xa0Pope Francis to arrive at Nagasaki in first papal visit to Japan in 38 yrsALSO READ |\\xa0Pope Francis in Thailand calls for action to protect women, children', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

She finally spelled it \\'cofefe\\'.Camerota then told Vinay the correct spelling was \\'covfefe\\' and added, \"It\\'s a nonsense word. So, we\\'re not sure that its root is actually in Sanskrit, which is what you\\'re probably, uh, used to using, so, I don\\'t know. Anyway.\"Criticism of Camerota\\'s comment has since been circulating on social media.Cuomo immediately congratulated Vinay for doing a great job, saying, \"You know what I love about this. Not only did you make yourself proud and your family, but do you know that there are kids all over the country, probably the world, who are going to look at you and say \\'I want to put in that work. I want to be a champion. I want to spell like her\\'.\"However, netizens were quick to criticise Camerota for assuming that Vinay would know Sanskrit, some calling her comment racist and others expressing disbelief that she would make such an assumption just because Vinay is of Indian-origin heritage.Susan Benesch wrote on Twitter, \"CNN guesses the US national spelling bee winner is \\'used to using\\' Sanskrit. If she were Jewish would u say \\'your real language is Hebrew\\'.\"Another user Jeremy McLellan, a standup comedian, wrote on Twitter \"12-year-old Ananya Vinay won the National Spelling Bee so naturally CNN had her on to spell \\'covfefe\\' and say some racist stuff to her.\"Asha Dahya, creator/editor-in-chief of female empowerment blog \\'GirlTalkHQ\\', wrote on Twitter, \"CNN anchor assumes spelling bee champ, who happens to be of Indian descent, uses Sanskrit to find the origin of a word.\"A CNN spokeswoman, in a report in the Washington Post, said Camoreta\\'s comment had nothing to do with the girl\\'s heritage, and that the interview was not the first time the anchor has joked about Sanskrit being the origin of \\'covfefe\\'.\"Alisyn made the same joking reference to the root of \\'covfefe\\' in an earlier panel discussion that was aired on Wednesday,\" the CNN spokeswoman said.\"If she\\'s guilty of anything it is recycling a joke.

During a high-level meeting, it was decided that one of the three PML-N leaders could be made premier for \\'45 days\\'. The other two candidates shortlisted are National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Petroleum Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.\"The prime minister\\'s legal team briefed him about the apex court\\'s proceedings and possible verdict.

Asif is very close to Sharif and considered anti-establishment.\"If Sharif is ousted by the Supreme Court there will be strong resentment in the ruling party against the establishment whom the PML-N believes to be involved in conspiracies against the premier. And Asif will be a perfect choice to give a befitting gesture to the establishment for its conspiracies,\" the PML-N leader said on anonymity.Sharif and his cabinet members have been alleging for weeks that conspiracies are being hatched to oust Nawaz Sharif. They openly blamed the military establishment and judiciary behind the plot for Sharif\\'s ouster.It was also decided during the meeting that the party will utilise all legal and constitutional options available if the verdict goes against the premier. The meeting, chaired by Sharif, was also attended by Shahbaz along with federal ministers, advisers and the legal team representing the Sharif family in the Panama Papers case. The meeting reviewed the situation following developments in the Supreme Court.Meanwhile, Asif rebuffed the reports about him becoming the interim prime minister. \"The entire party is behind the leadership of Sharif. There is no any prime ministerial candidate. There has been no discussion in the meeting on this issue,\" he said.Despite receiving adverse remarks during the court proceedings which the opposition parties believe a clear indication that the premier is going to get disqualified, Sharif reiterated his stance that he will not quit office. \"I will not quit on the demand of opposition as I am elected by the people of Pakistan,\" Sharif said.He, however, said he would accept the court\\'s decision.\\xa0Opposition Leader in National Assembly Khursheed Shah said that Sharif has only time till tomorrow to resign. \"He has two nights to decide about his resignation. His disqualification is a writing on the wall and he should honourably exist. The judges\\' remarks in Panama case has already foretold the court\\'s decision,\" he said.The apex court yesterday concluded hearing the sensitive Panama Papers case against Sharif and his family for alleged corruption and money laundering.The judgement was reserved after counsels of both sides concluded their arguments before a three-judge bench of the apex court headed by Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan.A six-member JIT was set up in May by the apex court with the mandate to probe the Sharif family for allegedly failing to provide the trail of money used to buy properties in London in 1990s. The JIT has recommended that the report\\'s Volume-X should be treated as confidential as it contains the details of correspondence with other countries. So far Sharif has refused to quit, calling the investigators\\' report a compilation of \"allegations and assumptions\".

This cannot be, we cannot accept it,\" he added.Netanyahu, who has been leading the executive since 2009 (and had previously served as Premier between 1996-99) said he had already initiated negotiations with Likud\\'s potential coalition partners on the right.\"They all committed to pursue our goals together,\" he said, as his supporters chanted \"We don\\'t want unity!\" - a reference to speculation that Likud could ally with its main rival Blue and White in these polls.Netanyahu, who is vying to win a record fifth term in office, declined to name Gantz in his speech or hint at any possible deal with the centrist coalition.He has pledged to annex Jewish settlements and a swathe of other territory in the occupied West Bank if he is returned to power. Palestinians, who seek a state in the West Bank and Gaza, with its capital in occupied East Jerusalem, have warned such a move will kill any hopes for peace.Gantz has not advocated any form of annexation though his position on the creation of a Palestinian state is unclear.Like Netanyahu, he has ruled out ever dividing Jerusalem, which Israel considers its capital.On Wednesday morning, Yisrael Beiteinu\\'s leader Avigdor Lieberman, reiterated that he would only support a government comprising both Likud and Blue and White.However, Blue and White has ruled out sitting with Netanyahu in a coalition.

He said there was no reason to continue in a war that was no longer in the service of the \\x93vital national interest\\x94 of the American people.\\x93I give you my word: With all of my heart, I believe this is the right decision, a wise decision, and the best decision for America,\\x94 Biden said in his address to the nation from the White House on Tuesday.\\x93We\\x92ve been a nation too long at war. If you\\x92re 20 years old today, you have never known an America at peace. So, when I hear that we could\\x92ve, should\\x92ve continued the so-called low-grade effort in Afghanistan, at low risk to our service members, at low cost, I don\\x92t think enough people understand how much we have asked of the 1 percent of this country who put that uniform on, who are willing to put their lives on the line in defense of our nation,\\x94 he said.Telling his fellow Americans that the war in Afghanistan is now over, Biden said he is the fourth President who has faced the issue of whether and when to end this war.\\x93When I was running for President, I made a commitment to the American people that I would end this war. And today, I\\x92ve honored that commitment. It was time to be honest with the American people again. We no longer had a clear purpose in an open-ended mission in Afghanistan,\\x94 he said.\\x93After 20 years of war in Afghanistan, I refused to send another generation of America\\x92s sons and daughters to fight a war that should have ended long ago,\\x94 Biden added.After more than USD 2 trillion spent in Afghanistan -- a cost that researchers at Brown University estimated would be over USD 300 million a day for 20 years in Afghanistan- for two decades, he said.\\x93If you take the number of USD 1 trillion, as many say, that\\x92s still USD 150 million a day for two decades. And what have we lost as a consequence in terms of opportunities? I refused to continue in a war that was no longer in the service of the vital national interest of our people,\\x94 he added.\\x93As Commander-in-Chief, I firmly believe the best path to guard our safety and our security lies in a tough, unforgiving, targeted, precise strategy that goes after terror where it is today, not where it was two decades ago. That\\x92s what\\x92s in our national interest,\\x94 the President said.Biden said that the world is changing and the US is confronted with new challenges.\\x93We\\x92re engaged in a serious competition with China. We\\x92re dealing with the challenges on multiple fronts with Russia. We\\x92re confronted with cyberattacks and nuclear proliferation,\\x94 he said.\\x93We have to shore up America\\x92s competitive[ness] to meet these new challenges in the competition for the 21st century. And we can do both: fight terrorism and take on new threats that are here now and will continue to be here in the future,\\x94 he added.Biden said, \\x93There\\x92s nothing China or Russia would rather have, would want more in this competition than the United States to be bogged down another decade in Afghanistan. As we turn the page on the foreign policy that has guided our nation the last two decades, we\\x92ve got to learn from our mistakes.\\x94He said the terror threat has spread across the world, well beyond Afghanistan.\\x93We face threats from al-Shabaab in Somalia; al Qaeda affiliates in Syria and the Arabian Peninsula; and ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq, and establishing affiliates across Africa and Asia,\\x94 he added.\\x93The fundamental obligation of a President, in my opinion, is to defend and protect America- not against threats of 2001, but against the threats of 2021 and tomorrow. That is the guiding principle behind my decisions about Afghanistan. I simply do not believe that the safety and security of America is enhanced by continuing to deploy thousands of American troops and spending billions of dollars a year in Afghanistan,\\x94 Biden said.\\x93But I also know that the threat from terrorism continues in its pernicious and evil nature. But it\\x92s changed, expanded to other countries. Our strategy has to change too,\\x94 he added.The United States, he said, will maintain the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan and other countries.\\x93We just don\\x92t need to fight a ground war to do it. We have what\\x92s called over-the-horizon capabilities, which means we can strike terrorists and targets without American boots on the ground- or very few, if needed,\\x94 he said.\\x93We\\x92ve shown that capacity just in the last week. We struck ISIS-K remotely, days after they murdered 13 of our servicemembers and dozens of innocent Afghans. And to ISIS-K: We are not done with you yet,\\x94 Biden said.(With PTI inputs)   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if (\\'\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || \\'undefined\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

      "['US jobless claims below 1 million for first time in COVID-19 Pandemic', 'The number of laid-off workers applying for unemployment aid fell below 1 million last week for the first time since the pandemic intensified five months ago yet still remains at a high level.', 'a large video display reads \"Now hiring for our new hotel coming soon!,\" at the new Emerald Queen Casino, which is open, and owned by the Puyallup Tribe of Indians, in Tacoma, Wash. The United States added 1.8 million jobs in July, a pullback from the gains of May and June and evidence that the resurgent coronavirus has weakened hiring and the economic rebound.The number of laid-off workers applying for unemployment aid fell below 1 million last week for the first time since the pandemic intensified five months ago yet still remains at a high level. The viral pandemic keeps forcing layoffs just as the expiration of a $600-a-week federal jobless benefit has deepened the hardships for many.The Labor Department said applications fell to 963,000, the second straight drop, from 1.2 million the previous week. The decline suggests that layoffs are slowing, though last week\\x92s figure still exceeds the pre-pandemic record of just under 700,000.The pandemic, the shutdowns that are meant to fight it and the reluctance or inability of many people to shop, travel or eat out are continuing to weaken the economy and force companies to cut staff. Twenty-three states have paused or reversed their business re-openings. In a hopeful sign, the rate of new confirmed viral cases has declined in the past couple of weeks, though it remains far above the rates that prevailed in May and June.All told, fewer people are also continuing to receive state jobless aid. That figure dropped to 15.5 million, from 16.1 million the previous week.For months, the unemployed had also been receiving the $600 a week in federal jobless aid on top of their state benefit. But the federal payment has expired, and negotiations in Congress to extend that benefit, likely at a lower level of payment, have collapsed in rancor.The supplemental federal aid had enabled many jobless Americans to afford rent, food and utilities, and its expiration threatens to weaken consumer spending and further slow the economy. Unemployment benefits have accounted for roughly 5% of national income since April, a larger share than even Social Security. The loss of the $600 has shrunk benefits for the average recipient by one-half to three-quarters.Michelle Meyer, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says that the loss of the additional aid will reduce Americans\\x92 incomes by $18 billion a week.\\x93That\\x92s a big hit to purchasing power,\\x94 she said.Last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that would provide $300 a week in federal aid to the jobless to replace the expired $600-a-week benefit. But experts say it would take weeks for the states to implement that payment.In addition to people who applied last week for state benefits, nearly 489,000 others sought jobless aid under a new program that has made self-employed and gig workers eligible for the first time. That figure isn\\x92t adjusted for seasonal trends, so it\\x92s reported separately.But including that group, the Labor Department says 28.2 million people are receiving some form of unemployment benefits, though that figure may be inflated by double-counting by some states.For states to set up systems to distribute a new $300 federal jobless benefit, their labor departments would need more guidance from the federal government, noted Michele Evermore, a senior researcher at the National Employment Law Project. The money, which is supposed to come from a federal disaster relief fund, would likely require states to hire more people and possibly contract with software vendors to establish a system to process the payments, Evermore said.\\x93I can\\x92t imagine that this goes up in less than a month anywhere,\\x94 she said.After the pandemic hit, Congress approved a $2 trillion aid package. Among other things, it provided the $600-a-week benefit and made self-employed and gig workers newly eligible for unemployment aid.Both programs required the states to create new processing systems while handling a crush of benefit applications. That influx resulted in huge backlogs and left millions of the unemployed frustrated by their inability to access benefits. Washington state, for one, eventually called in National Guard troops to help process applications.In the meantime, with confirmed virus cases still high, it\\x92s not clear when business owners will be able to reopen or will have enough customers to rehire.Grace Della is one of them. She opened her food tour business in Miami a decade ago with $300 from her mother. On weekends, she led the tours herself and eventually built up a business with 13 tour guides, averaging 10 tours a day through culinary hot spots in South Beach and Little Havana.Yet with the risk of infection still high and with scant customer demand, it\\x92s been more than four months since Miami Culinary Tours has taken out guests, and Della, 46, says she doesn\\x92t expect to recall her employees anytime soon.She hopes to reopen later this month but isn\\x92t sure she can, given the state\\x92s high level of confirmed infections.

Soon after Kadono tested positive for the coronavirus and hospitalized in early April, her friends let her know that groundless rumors were circulating.(Arisa Kadono via AP)\\xa0The coronavirus in Japan has brought not just an epidemic of infections, but also an onslaught of bullying and discrimination against the sick, their families and health workers. A government campaign to raise awareness seems to be helping, at least for medical workers. But it\\x92s made only limited headway in countering the harassment and shunning that may be discouraging people from seeking testing and care and hindering the battle against the pandemic.When Arisa Kadono tested positive and was hospitalized in early April, she was only identified as a woman in her 20s in food business. Soon, friends let her know that groundless rumors were circulating: that the family-run bar she helps with was a hotbed of virus; that she had dined with a popular baseball player who was infected earlier but she has never met; that she was sneaking out of the hospital and spreading the virus.\\x93It was as if I was a criminal,\\x94 Kadono said in an interview from her home in Himeji, western Japan, after ending her three-week hospitalization.Apart from a fever on the first day and a loss of smell, Kadono had no major symptoms though she repeatedly tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Her mother developed pneumonia and was briefly in intensive care at another hospital.\\x93There are many other people who also have faced discrimination and prejudice,(asterisk) said Kadono, who decided to speak out on her own behalf and that of other COVID-19 survivors and their families. \\x93I really want to change people\\x92s tendency to blame those who get infected.(asterisk)Apart from fear of infection, experts say the prejudice against those even indirectly associated with the illness also stems from deeply rooted ideas about purity and cleanliness in a culture that rejects anything deemed to be alien, unclean or troublesome.Medical workers risking their lives to care for patients are a main target, but people working at grocery stores, delivering parcels and carrying out other essential jobs also are facing harassment. So are their family members.\\x93I can imagine people fear the virus, but we are working hard at the front lines under enormous pressure,\\x94 said a nurse in her 30s, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear she might be targeted if identified. \\x93We also have our own families we care about. Discrimination against us just because we are medical workers is discouraging and demoralizing.\\x94Another nurse was approached by a few mothers and asked to leave a Tokyo park she was visiting with her children. Some nurses are unwelcome at restaurants they usually eat at. Some are rejected by taxi drivers. The Health Ministry issued a directive to day care facilities after some barred the children of doctors and nurses.A veteran nurse in the northern island of Hokkaido said the mother of one of her coworkers was suspended from work. The husband of another was told at a job interview he wouldn\\x92t be hired because of his wife\\x92s job.The nurses, both assigned to COVID-19 patients, were staying at hotels to protect their families while working under severe conditions without adequate protective equipment and testing.\\x93We understand people\\x92s fears, but medical workers are doing their utmost to prevent infections at hospitals. We seek your support,\\x94 said Toshiko Fukui, head of the Japanese Nursing Association.\\x93We are not asking for anything special. ... Just a word of thanks is a huge reward that boosts our motivation,\\x94 Fukui said.The backlash against coronavirus patients may lead some who fall sick to avoid seeking medical care, raising the risks of infection spreading further, clinical psychologist Reo Morimitsu at the Suwa Red Cross Hospital said in an interview with NHK public television. Reports said Japanese police last month found about a dozen people dead at home alone or collapsed on the streets who later tested positive for the virus.\\x93The virus not only infects our body but also our minds and behavior, harming us and dividing our society,\\x94 Morimitsu said.Prejudice against those not viewed as mainstream or \\x93pure\\x94 is a legacy of feudal times, when some Japanese engaged in professions such as leather tanning and butchering were deemed unclean. Their descendants still face discrimination. People suffering from ailments such as Hansen\\x92s disease, or leprosy, were likewise forced to live in isolation decades after a cure was found.Victims of the 1945 U.S. atomic bomb attacks on Japan, known as \\x93hibakusha,\\x94 and others injured in industrial accidents such as mercury poisoning have faced similar treatment. More recently, some who fled the 2011 nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima have suffered bullying and harassment.\\x93Underlying the (coronavirus) discrimination is a sense that the patients are impure,\\x94 Naoki Sato, an expert on criminology and Japanese culture at the Kyushu Institute of Technology, wrote in a recent article in the Gendai Business online magazine. \\x93Growing anxiety and fear of infection are adding to discrimination against the infected.\\x94Random acts of hatred have been reported from across the country:\\x97 Arson threats were made against Kyoto Sangyo University after some of its students were infected.\\x97 An Osaka city assemblyman compared a young patient to \\x93a murderer\\x94 of elderly people.\\x97 In Mie, central Japan, people threw stones at a patient\\x92s house and vandalized property.\\x97 In Iwate, a man died while in self-quarantine after his future neighbors sought to bar him from moving into a retirement home and the local government office refused to register him.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other officials have denounced such behavior.\\x93It\\x92s shameful,\\x94 Abe told a recent parliamentary session. \\x93Anyone could get infected.\\x94Some places in Japan have begun following the examples set in Europe and elsewhere of sending messages of appreciation and praising medical workers and others in essential jobs. Some offices have started collecting donations and other support for hospitals.The belated campaign to raise awareness and combat corona discrimination is only a first step, but it\\x92s a start, said the nurse from Hokkaido.\\x93People started to cheer us,\\x94 she said. \\x93Neighborhood stores sometimes bring us treats like pancakes, fried noodles and milk.\\x94', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

The service was launched on Tuesday alongside the new cross-governmental campaign Cyber Aware, which promotes recommended behaviours to stay as secure as possible online.The Cyber Aware campaign is delivered by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) working alongside the UK Home Office, Cabinet Office and Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). The NCSC was launched as the experts at the government\\'s cyber security centre noted a trend of fake coronavirus-related services in malicious emails tricking people into online harm. Over 5,000 suspect emails were reported to the centre by Wednesday.The NCSC has clamped down on at least 83 web scams within a day after it launched a new \"Suspicious Email Reporting Service\" for the public. This \"Suspicious Email Reporting Service\" was co-developed with the City of London Police. Apart from taking down malicious sites, it will support UK policing by providing live time analysis of reports and identifying new patterns in online offending - helping them stop even more offenders in their tracks.\"The immediate take-up of our new national reporting service shows that the UK is united in its defence against callous attempts to trick people online,\" said NCSC CEO Ciaran Martin. \"While we have not seen a rise in email scams in the last month, coronavirus is the top lure currently used to conduct cyber crime \\x96 exploiting public unease and fear of the pandemic. We hope the success of the \\'Suspicious Email Reporting Service\\' deters criminals from such scams, but if you do receive something that doesn\\'t look right forward the message to us \\x96 you will be helping to protect the UK from email scams and cyber crime,\" he said.Once any dubious emails \\x96 including those claiming to offer support related to coronavirus \\x96 are forwarded to report@phishing.gov.uk, the NCSC\\'s automated\\xad programme immediately tests the validity of the site. Any sites found involved in phishing scams are removed immediately. \"This new service allows the public to take the power back from the criminal, and it\\'s fantastic so many people have utilised it already. This will assist the police in tracking down those responsible for sending these scam emails, and help in bringing them to justice,\" said Commander Karen Baxter, City of London Police, National Lead for Fraud.The initial 83 takedowns relate to phishing attacks, or untargeted mass emails sent to many people asking for sensitive information (such as bank details) or encouraging you to visit a fake website.

In the years since, it has drifted off the Dahlak archipelago, a chain of islands off the coast of the nearby African nation of Eritrea in the Red Sea. It likely received supply replenishments and switched crew via passing Iranian vessels using the waterway.Briefing materials from the Saudi military earlier obtained by The Associated Press showed men on the vessel dressed in camouflage, military-style fatigues, as well as small boats capable of ferrying cargo to the Yemeni coast. That briefing material also included pictures showing a variety of antennas on the vessel that the Saudi government described as unusual for a commercial cargo ship, suggesting it conducted electronic surveillance.\\xa0The Washington Institute for Near-East Policy has called the Saviz an ôIranian mothershipö in the region, similarly describing it as an intelligence-gathering base and an armory for the Guard. Policy papers from the institute don\\'t explain how they came to that conclusion, though its analysts routinely have access to Gulf and Israeli military sources.The Saviz had been under international sanctions until Iran\\'s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which saw Tehran receive economic relief in exchange for limiting its enrichment of uranium. The Trump administration later renewed American sanctions on the Saviz as part of its decision to unilaterally withdraw from the accord.\\xa0In June 2019, Saudi Arabia flew a critically ill Iranian off the Saviz after Tehran made a request through the United Nations for assistance.\\xa0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

The spoksperson also rejected reports that the virus emanated from a wet market in the central Chinese city from bats or pangolins before infecting humans. Hua\\x92s comments came in response to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\\x92s allegations of a cover-up by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).The coronavirus crisis was infinitely made worse by the Chinese Communist Party\\x92s cover-up, Pompeo had said in Tokyo at the QUAD ministerial meeting of the US, India, Australia and Japan on Tuesday.The Chinese Foreign Ministry statement was made as the World Health Organisation (WHO) was gearing up to probe the origin of the deadly coronavirus.According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 36 million people and killed more than 1 million across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 7.6 million cases and more than 2,12,000 deaths. China has reported 90,736 cases and 4,739 deaths due to COVID-19.The WHO has given to Beijing a list of global experts to be sent to China to probe the origin of the coronavirus, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Thursday. The WHO is awaiting its approval.In May, the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the Geneva-based WHO\\x92s decision-making body currently headed by India, passed a unanimous resolution to probe the origin of the virus. China also backed the resolution.In August, a two-member team from the WHO, which visited China, completed the groundwork for the probe into the animal source and reservoirs of the COVID-19 which first emerged in Wuhan in December last year.On Monday, WHO health emergencies programme executive director Mike Ryan told a special meeting of the organisation\\x92s executive board that \\x93a list of candidates has been submitted to the Chinese authorities for their consideration and for the next steps in order to deploy that team\\x94.Hua, while refuting Pompeo\\x92s charge of a cover-up, said that a high-level group of Chinese scientists first identified the person-to-person transmission due to coronavirus on January 19. After a thorough research and investigation, China made the decision at the earliest and closed Wuhan city to the outside world and placed most rigorous measures in isolating Wuhan city and Hubei province, Hua said.She said that the CPC Politburo discussed the virus outbreak on the first day of the Lunar New Year in January and convened a meeting on the outbreak of its 31 provinces and municipalities, and activated the level one emergency response.\\x93On January 23 as China placed Wuhan on lockdown, there were only nine confirmed cases outside China and the US had only one. On February 2, when the US closed its border to the Chinese citizens, the US only officially confirmed a dozen cases. Now the confirmed cases in the US exceeded 7.5 million and 2.10 lakh deaths,\\x94 she said.\\x93How could the most powerful country on earth with the best medical resources on hand screw up the tests so badly. Why hasn\\x92t the US discovered this virus at the earliest and why hasn\\x92t it taken prompt measures to test as many people as possible to prevent and control the spread of this virus?\\x94 Hua asked.The COVID-19, which originated in China\\'s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a \"severe recession\".Scientists are racing against time to find a vaccine or medicine for treating coronavirus patients.(With PTI Inputs)', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

However, the meeting observed that Islamabad will have to take further steps in these four months, Dawn news reported.The FATF has linked the blacklisting of Pakistan with unsatisfactory steps to curb money laundering and terror financing. The FATF will take a final decision on the matter in February 2020.A formal announcement about these developments will be made on October 18.Pakistan Finance Ministry spokesperson Omar Hameed Khan was approached to verify the news but he said: \"It is not true and nothing before October 18.\"A Pakistani delegation led by Minister for Economic Affairs Hammad Azhar told the meeting that Islamabad has made positive progress in 20 out of 27 points. The FATF expressed satisfaction on the mea\\xad\\xadsures taken by Pakistan and its progress in various areas.While China, Turkey and Malaysia appreciated the steps taken by Pakistan, India has recommended its blacklisting on the plea that Islamabad has allowed Hafiz Saeed to withdraw funds from his frozen accounts.Concerns were also raised on the tax amnesty scheme offered in Pakistan.On the outright support extended by Turkey, China and Malaysia, the FATF decided not to include Pakistan on the blacklist and give it more time to implement the remaining measures.According to the FATF charter comprising 36 countries, the support of at least three countries is required to not blacklist any country.In August 2019, the Asia-Pacific Group, a regional affiliate of the FATF, also expressed concern over Pakistan\\'s performance due to technical flaws.

His decision to stay in power was endorsed by the federal cabinet last week.However, the three-member apex bench observed that Sharif has not provided the details of all assets and source of income in the form of his tax returns.Justice Ijazul Ahsan said the Sharif family has not produced any document to prove that the prime minister\\'s son Hussain Nawaz was the original owner of the London flats. He said JIT has found that Sharif\\'s daughter Maryam was the real owner of those apartments.Justice Ejaz Afzal told Sharif\\'s counsel that the Sharif family has not provided the money trail to establish that the London flats were legally purchased.\"We have been waiting for them since day one to come forward and provide the money trail,\" he said, but added that the court would decide the case on the basis of evidence and it was not bound by the findings of the JIT.Justice Azmat Saeed Sheikh raised questions about the sources of funds used to set up the Hill Metal steel company in Saudi Arabia, which is allegedly owned by the Sharifs.The judges appeared quite aggressive and grilled Sharif\\'s counsel about the source of money used to establish businesses in Gulf and the UK by the Sharif family.\"The real question is where did the money for [family] properties in Saudi Arabia, Dubai and London came from? We have not yet received an answer to this fundamental question,\" Justice Ijazul Ahsan said.The bench also asked Sharif\\'s counsel whether the court should decide the case by its opinion over the concealment of facts or refer the case to an accountability court for trial.The counsel urged the court to decide it on merit andstressed that the JIT was biased and his client had done nothing illegal.Later, finance minister Ishaq Dar\\'s counsel began his arguments but the court adjourned the case until tomorrow.The scandal surfaced when the Panama Papers leaks last year revealed that Sharif\\'s sons - Hassan and Hussain - and his daughter Maryam- owned offshore companies which managed their family\\'s properties. The assets in question include four expensive flats in Park Lane, London.Opposition parties say the London flats were purchased through illegal money which Sharif and his family have rejected.

If we want to avoid catastrophic climate change, the highest priority must be to reduce CO2 pollution to zero at the earliest possible date,\" he noted.While the year-to-year increase of 1.8 ppm in the May CO2 peak was slightly less than previous years, CO2 measurements for the first five months of 2021 showed a 2.3 ppm increase over the same five months of 2020, close to the average annual increase from 2010 to 2019.Covid-induced lockdowns in 2020 led to a 5.8 per cent decline in global energy-related CO2 emissions, the largest annual percentage decline since World War, revealed a March report by the International Energy Agency -- IEA.However, with the opening up of lockdowns and pandemic-induced restrictions loosened, global CO2 emissions started climbing again.CO2 emissions will see a rise of 1.5 billion tonnes -- the second-largest annual increase ever -- in 2021, the IEA said in its latest report. While this would be the biggest annual increase in emissions since 2010, it would reverse most of last year\\'s decline caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the IEA said.The NOAA report, however, stated that the effect of the pandemic had no discernible effect on the historic CO2 record.The current atmospheric burden of CO2 is comparable to where it was during the Pliocene Climatic Optimum, between 4.1 and 4.5 million years ago, when CO2 was close to, or above 400 ppm. During that time, sea level was about 78 feet higher than today, the average temperature was 7 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in pre-industrial times, and studies indicate large forests occupied areas of the Arctic that are now tundra, the report said.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

They have made limited progress in achieving disengagement at the Pangong Lake area while negotiations for similar steps at other friction points remained deadlocked.Asked about the growing proximity between Russia and China and if that will impact the Indo-Russia security and defence cooperation, Putin said the relations between India and Russia were developing quite rapidly, quite successfully based on \"trust\".\"We highly appreciate such a high level of cooperation with our Indian friends. These relations are of a strategic nature. They cover a whole range of avenues of our cooperation in economy, energy and hi-tech. In defence, and I am not just talking about purchase of Russian arms.

The veteran lawman expressed confidence that could be a matter ripe for investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, though he declined to offer an opinion on whether it met such a threshold.Trump\\x92s private attorney, Marc Kasowitz, seized on Comey\\x92s admission that he had told Trump on multiple occasions that he was not personally under investigation and maintained the testimony made clear that Trump \\x93never, in form or substance, directed or suggested that Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone.\\x94Kasowitz also jumped on Comey\\x92s revelation that he had released details of his private conversations with the president, casting the former FBI director as one of the \\x93leakers\\x94 set on undermining the Trump administration.Still, there was no doubt the veteran lawman made for a challenging adversary.\\x93It\\x92s my judgment that I was fired because of the Russia investigation,\\x94 Comey said toward the end of more than two hours of testimony before the Senate intelligence committee. \\x93I was fired in some way to change, or the endeavor was to change, the way the Russia investigation was being conducted.\\x93That is a very big deal, and not just because it involves me.\\x94At one point he practically dared Trump to release any recordings of their conversations, a prospect the president once alluded to in a tweet.\\x93Lordy, I hope there are tapes,\\x94 Comey said, suggesting such evidence would back up his account over the president\\x92s.Thursday\\x92s hearing brought Washington and other parts of the country to a standstill as Americans sat glued to their screens, harkening to the Watergate congressional hearings that held the nation rapt some four decades earlier.Republicans mindful of the gravity of the moment worked feverishly to lessen any damage from the hearing. They tried to undermine Comey\\x92s credibility by issuing press releases and even ads pointing to a past instance where the FBI had to clean up the director\\x92s testimony to Congress.In his opening statement, Comey somberly accused the Trump administration of spreading \\x93lies, plain and simple\\x94 in the aftermath of his abrupt ouster, declaring that the administration \\x93chose to defame me and, more importantly, the FBI\\x94 by claiming the bureau was in disorder.He then dove into the heart of the fraught political controversy around his firing and whether Trump interfered in the bureau\\x92s Russia investigation, as he elaborated on written testimony released a day earlier.In that testimony, Comey said that Trump demanded his \\x93loyalty\\x94 and directly pushed him to \\x93lift the cloud\\x94 of investigation by declaring publicly the president was not a target of the FBI probe into his campaign\\x92s Russia ties.He said that when Trump told him he hoped he would terminate an investigation into Michael Flynn, the ousted national security adviser, he interpreted that as a directive.\\x93I mean, this is the president of the United States, with me alone, saying, \\x91I hope\\x92 this,\\x94 he said. \\x93I took it as, this is what he wants me to do.\\x94He said that while he found the February exchange in the Oval Office disturbing, \\x93that\\x92s a conclusion I\\x92m sure the special counsel will work towards, to try and understand what the intention was there, and whether that\\x92s an offense.\\x94Comey said that after his firing he actually tried to spur the special counsel\\x92s appointment by giving a damning memo he had written about a meeting with Trump to a friend to release to the media.\\x93My judgment was I need to get that out into the public square,\\x94 he said.The February meeting was one of several one-on-one encounters that Comey said made him feel such intense discomfort that he felt compelled to document them in memos.\\x93I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, so I thought it really important to document,\\x94 he said. \\x93I knew there might come a day when I might need a record of what happened not only to defend myself but to protect the FBI.\\x94Trump himself was expected to dispute Comey\\x92s claims that he demanded loyalty and asked the FBI director to drop the investigation into Flynn, according to a person close to the president\\x92s legal team who was not authorized to discuss legal strategy by name and demanded anonymity. Instead, Kasowitz pushed back and the president remained conspicuously silent on Twitter during the hearing despite expectations he might respond.The disclosures that followed Comey\\x92s firing have raised questions about why Comey, known in government for an independent streak and a willingness to buck protocol, did not speak out publicly while on the job, or at least make his objections directly known to the president.Discussing the meeting in which Comey says Trump asked him to back off Flynn, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California asked, \\x93Why didn\\x92t you stop and say, \\x91Mr. President, this is wrong,\\x92?\\x94\\x93It\\x92s a great question,\\x94 Comey replied. \\x93Maybe if I were stronger I would have. I was so stunned by the conversation I just took it in.\\x94Comey also made clear that political entanglement in law enforcement has cut across party lines.During a discussion of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, Comey disclosed that then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, an Obama administration appointee, instructed him to refer to the issue as a \\x93matter,\\x94 not an \\x93investigation.\\x94\\x93That concerned me because that language tracked how the campaign was talking about the FBI\\x92s work and that\\x92s concerning,\\x94 he said. \\x93We had an investigation open at the time so that gave me a queasy feeling.\\x94Many Democrats still blame Comey for Clinton\\x92s loss, leading Trump to apparently believe they would applaud him for firing Comey.

To date, this variant covers more than 50 per cent of the existing viruses in this area. The rate and speed of the spread recall those of the \\'British variant\\'\", said Federico Giorgi, Professor at the varsity\\'s Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology.T478K mutation was earlier identified in the Delta variant and in the B.1.1.519 lineage.T478K was also present in around 65 per cent of occurrences in variant B.1.1.222, first detected in Mexico last year and associated with higher infectivity.Viruses constantly change through mutation. A variant has one or more mutations that differentiate it from other variants in circulation.Similar to other strains, the T478K is present in the spike protein that is responsible for the interaction with the human receptor ACE2. Coronaviruses attach to this receptor to infect cells, thus spreading the infection with more efficacy.Researchers tested the action of T478K Spike protein within silico simulations and found out that this mutated protein can alter the superficial electrostatic charge.Consequently, it can change not only the interaction with the ACE2 human protein but also with the antibodies of the immune system and thus hinder drug efficacy.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

He added that Raza had previously posted other blasphemous material on Facebook.Pakistan is a predominantly Sunni Muslim country and the rivalry between Shia and Sunni Muslims dates back to the seventh century when they had a disagreement who should be the heir to Islam's Prophet Mohammed.Under Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws, anyone accused of insulting God, Islam or other religious personalities can be sentenced to death.Pakistan last year arrested 15 people, 10 Muslims and five non-Muslims, on blasphemy charges, according to a report issued by the independent rights group Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.The country has never executed anyone convicted of blasphemy, but the mere accusation is enough to ignite mob violence or lynching in the deeply conservative country. Right groups say the harsh blasphemy laws are often used to settle personal scores.Earlier this year, a student in the country's conservative northwestern province was attacked and killed by a stick-wielding mob who accused him of blasphemy. There was no evidence of blasphemy, and his death generated widespread protests.In January 2011, a provincial governor was shot and killed by his police guard who accused him of blasphemy after he criticized the law and defended a Christian woman sentenced to death under the law.In recent months, the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif launched a campaign to rid social media of any content considered insulting to Islam, at least any posted by Pakistanis.The government petitioned Facebook and Twitter to identify Pakistanis worldwide posting material considered offensive to Islam so that Pakistani authorities can prosecute them or pursue their extradition on charges of blasphemy, tantamount to a death sentence.(With AP inputs)\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

For example, the same bitcoin mining operation that funded the registration payment for DCLeaks.com also funded the servers and domains used in the spearphishing campaign, the indictment said.\"The Internet allows foreign adversaries to attack America in new and unexpected ways,\" Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein said.\"Together with our law enforcement partners, the Department of Justice is resolute in its commitment to locate, identify and seek to bring to justice anyone who interferes with American elections,\" he said.\"Free and fair elections are hard-fought and contentious, and there will always be adversaries who work to exacerbate domestic differences and try to confuse, divide, and conquer us. So long as we are united in our commitment to the shared values enshrined in the Constitution, they will not succeed,\" Rosenstein added.The White House said there were allegations in this indictment that Americans knew that they were corresponding with Russians. \"There is no allegation in this indictment that any American citizen committed a crime. There is no allegation that the conspiracy changed the vote count or affected any election result,\" the White House Deputy Spokesperson Lindsay Walters said.\"Today\\'s charges include no allegations of knowing involvement by anyone on the campaign and no allegations that the alleged hacking affected the election result.

Another 17 million workers at health facilities that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid also will have to be vaccinated, as will all employees of the executive branch and contractors who do business with the federal government.The move brought Republican outrage from state capitals, Congress and the campaign trail, including from many who have supported vaccinations and have urged their constituents to take the shots.\\x93The vaccine itself is life-saving, but this unconstitutional move is terrifying,\\x94 tweeted Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves.Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw, who has promoted the vaccines\\x92 safety to his constituents, said, \\x93The right path is built upon explaining, educating and building trust, including explaining the risks/benefits/pros/cons in an honest way so a person can make their own decision.\\x94More than 208 million Americans have received at least one vaccine dose, but some 80 million remain unvaccinated, driving infections. There are now about 300% more new daily COVID-19 infections, about two-and-a-half times the hospitalizations and nearly twice the number of deaths as at the same time last year.While breakthrough infections do happen among the vaccinated, those cases tend to be far less severe, with the vast majority of deaths and serious illnesses occurring among those who have not received shots.The pandemic is worsening in many of the states where governors are most loudly protesting the president\\x92s actions. South Carolina, for example, is averaging more than 5,000 new cases per day and has the nation\\x92s second-highest infection rate. A hospital system there started canceling elective surgeries this week to free staff to help with a crush of COVID-19 patients.In a section of Idaho, overwhelmed hospitals have implemented new crisis standards to ration care for patients. And in Georgia, hospitals have been turning away ambulances bringing emergency or ICU patients.\\x93I am so disappointed that particularly some Republican governors have been so cavalier with the health of these kids, so cavalier with the health of their communities,\\x94 Biden said during his school visit. \\x93This isn\\x92t a game.\\x94But Republicans and some union officials say the president is overreaching his constitutional authority. They take issue, in particular, with the idea that millions could lose their jobs if they refuse to take the shots.\\x93That\\x92s a ridiculous choice,\\x94 said Mississippi Gov. Reeves.Biden, however, says he\\x92s doing what needs to be done to fight resistance that has continued despite months of encouragement and incentives. In his White House speech announcing the new measures, he was visibly frustrated, criticizing the remaining holdouts and accusing some elected officials of \\x93actively working to undermine the fight against COVID-19.\\x94\\x93Instead of encouraging people to get vaccinated and mask up, they\\x92re ordering mobile morgues for the unvaccinated dying from COVID in their communities,\\x94 he said.Court fights are sure to follow in a number of states.Vaccine mandates are supported by a small majority of Americans. An August poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found majorities support requiring vaccinations for health care workers, teachers at K-12 schools and public-facing workers like those who work in restaurants and stores. Overall, 55% back vaccine mandates for government workers. And about half of working adults favor vaccine mandates at their own workplaces.But the numbers are deeply polarized, with Democrats far more likely to support mandates than Republicans, who have also been less supportive when it comes to getting shots themselves.While demand for vaccinations has risen over the summer, a persistent number of Americans have said they have no intention of ever receiving them.GOP pollster Frank Luntz, who has held focus groups and worked with the Biden administration to try to combat vaccine hesitance, says that, without further measures, Biden is likely to see vaccinations top out at about 75% of the population.\\x93The only way to exceed that, which he needs to for herd immunity, is to mandate it,\\x94 Luntz said. \\x93It will make a lot of people angry and even more resistant, but those who are simply hesitant will act now. He\\x92s done the best he can under the circumstances.\\x94Still, many Republicans are unmoving and unforgiving, especially those who are running for office and see the issue as one that could motivate Republican voters to turn out in next year\\x92s midterm elections.Mike Gibbons, who is running for the U.S. Senate in Ohio, accused \\x93Joe Biden and his Big Brother administration\\x94 of having \\x93crossed into authoritarian territory.\\x94\\x93The American people have a right to assess the risks and benefits of the vaccine and make the decision on what is best for themselves and their families,\\x94 he said. \\x93That decision should be made by doctors and the individual, not the government.\\x94With the midterms coming, Drew McKissick, South Carolina\\x92s GOP chairman, says he imagines Democrats in his state being tied to their party\\x92s \\x93radical liberal\\x94 policies.\\x93South Carolinians don\\x92t take kindly to mandates. They never have,\\x94 McKissick said, arguing the national political tenor is \\x93going to put (Democrats) more in a corner.\\x94But Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist who leads the pro-Biden super PAC Unite the Country, which has also done polling showing support for mandates, said he\\x92s not especially concerned about potential political backlash.

One governor was found with nine tons in his office \\x96 when, unusually, he was sacked, he joined the Taliban with his 3,000 men.By 2010, a US diplomatic cable quoted the Afghan national security adviser saying \"corruption is not just a problem for the system of governance in Afghanistan \\x96 it is the system of governance\".But the West\\'s money kept flowing as shameless politicians spoke about stability: almost a trillion dollars spent by the US over two decades and 30 billion pounds by Britain, including 3.3 billion pounds on aid, in a country of 38 million people, the report added.If all the international aid spent had simply been divided up among Afghans, each citizen could have become an instant millionaire.It shows the lethal impact of pouring aid into a fragile, conflict-riven country, while the two-decade debacle, backed by floods of donor cash at times bigger than the entire Afghan economy, helped transform the aid sector into a greedy, pernicious and self-serving industry filled with fat-cats.Sadly, all the warning signs were ignored. More than a decade ago, Richard Holbrooke, US special envoy to the region, said corruption was destroying efforts to create a fledgling democracy. He called it the Taliban\\'s \"No 1 recruiting tool\".Now the legacy is clear, with heartbreaking scenes of fundamentalist bigots seizing control.No surprise that President Ashraf Ghani fled last week, reportedly in a helicopter stuffed with stolen cash.Yet the West turned a blind eye not just to corruption, electoral fraud, and the creation of a mafia state but even to the trafficking of boys into sex slavery, the report said.The UN warned more than a decade ago that Afghan security forces were \"recruiting boys, sometimes with sexual exploitation as a motivating factor\".Yet last year the US State Department admitted there was still a \"pattern of sexual slavery in government compounds\", with high-ranking officials involved in \\'bacha bazi\\' (a tradition of rich older men recruiting boys for entertainment, including to dance for them dressed as girls, and rape) yet routinely avoiding prosecution.In the first years after the 2001 invasion, budgets were comparatively tight, as the focus was on stifling terrorism.Many schemes were absurd. Take the spending of 32 million pounds on a single natural gas fuel station \\x96 140 times more than a similar one in Pakistan \\x96 only to discover it cost more than the average annual income for Afghans to convert their cars to drive on natural gas, so there was little use.Christopher Kolenda, a colonel who advised three US commanders in Afghanistan, said that by 2006 the government had \"self-organized into a kleptocracy\".Politicians paid to be given official posts, then recouped costs \"from assistance programs, selling uniforms or ammunition on the black market, drug-trafficking or kidnapping\".The big beneficiaries were the crooks in charge and the Dubai property market, where many stashed their stolen wealth.One powerbroker at a Kabul bank used a web of fake firms to make fraudulent loans to ministers, officials, and warlords, leading to losses equivalent to one-twelfth of the size of the country\\'s economy.The bank also spent 117 million pounds on 35 luxury villas on Dubai\\'s Palm Jumeirah island complex, which is used for entertaining.The slow-burn catastrophe was charted by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, an unusually pugnacious official body, with quarterly reports and probing investigations.The watchdog concluded the West spent so much that it achieved the opposite of what was intended \\x96 for the cash \"often exacerbated conflicts, enabled corruption, and bolstered support for insurgents\".In too many cases, it added, the amount of money spent \"became the main metric for success\".At one point, the US Congress estimated 3.3 billion pounds \\x96 equal to 22 percent of Afghanistan\\'s GDP \\x96 was being smuggled out of the country, with two-thirds of this illegally earned.But government ministers and airport bosses frustrated efforts to thwart this destructive capital flight. Four years ago there was a US-led seminar on how to spot fraud.One person attending said he knew of a person due to travel that day to Dubai with a hoard of loot, who was apprehended at Kabul airport with 92 lb of gold bars worth 1.5 million pounds.Meanwhile, scores of schools were built to Western standards, five times more costly than those put up by charities.But cranes could not be used to install the heavy roof designs in much of the mountainous terrain and lighter replacements sometimes collapsed in heavy winter snowfalls.The US spent 800 million pounds on these schools, yet half had insufficient tables or chairs. Others that did not exist received funding, while some teachers were forging attendance lists.A power plant cost 246 million pounds, 10 times more than planned, then delivered less than one percent of intended capacity since Afghan officials could not afford the fuel. Even a 62 million pound loan for a hotel opposite the US embassy disappeared, leaving an empty shell.Police advisers watched TV cop shows to learn about policing while, over the past decade, the Pentagon spent almost 3 billion pounds on fuel for Afghan defense forces but half was stolen. Security bases were built but never used.Weapons went missing and a 403 million pound fleet of transport planes left to rot on a runway before being sold as scrap for 29,550 pounds.Gert Berthold, an accountant who helped analyze 3,000 contracts worth 78 billion pounds, concluded that four in every ten dollars ended up in the pockets of corrupt officials, gangsters, or insurgents.In Helmand, the center of British operations, a new police chief five years ago found about half of 26,000 security personnel assigned to the province \"did not exist when we asked for help\".One Afghan contractor, paid to cover flood culverts under roads to prevent bomb attacks on military vehicles, faked photos of the work submitted with his invoices \\x96 and two soldiers died as a result of his duplicity.Washington tripled the number of civilians to accompany the troop surge that started in 2009, spending almost 1.5 billion pounds. It turned out later the average cost of each civilian deployment was between 300,000 pounds and 420,000 pounds.Meanwhile, 110 million pounds was spent in four years on food, security, and villas for a management team of fewer than 10 people.One frustrated US official argued it was better to let Afghan warlords skim off 20 percent than to hire outside experts who would spend almost all the funds on overheads, salaries, and profits.Nine Italian goats from Tuscany were airlifted into the country as part of a 4.4 million pound scheme planned by the Pentagon to help the Afghan cashmere industry and create thousands of jobs.The blond billy goats were sent to breed with darker females to boost the yield and quality of the luxury wool from nine million local goats.But several fell sick, their newly designed home was too small, huge food costs made the plans unsustainable, the intended Afghan partner pulled out, and the project chief quit in dismay.Those in charge could not even tell if the unfortunate goats ended up in a cooking pot. \"We don\\'t know,\" said John Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.\\xa0\"This was so poorly managed.\"', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

The anti-terrorism court (ATC) Lahore indicted Saeed and three of his top aides Hafiz Abdul Salam bin Muhammad, Muhammad Ashraf and Zafar Iqbal on terror financing charges on Wednesday, amidst intense international pressure on Pakistan to bring him to justice.The prosecution which was to present witnesses against Saeed, who is detained at the Kot Lakhpat jail here, and others failed to bring them to the court as the lawyers have been on a strike for the last three days protesting against the arrest of their colleagues in a case of hooliganism at a hospital in Lahore.\"Except the arrested lawyers, no other suspect or witness in any other case were presented before the ATC due to the lawyers strike during the last three days,\" a court official told PTI on Saturday.The ATC Lahore adjourned the hearing of the terror financing case against Saeed and others till December 16, the official said. ATC Judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta on Wednesday directed the prosecution to produce the witnesses and adjourned the hearing till Thursday.The court framed the terror financing charges on the four suspects in their presence. Deputy Prosecutor General Punjab Abdur Rauf had told the court that the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab police had \\'solid evidence\\' that Saeed and others were involved in terror financing.The CTD had registered 23 FIRs against Saeed and his accomplices on the charges of \"terror financing\" in different cities of Punjab province and arrested Saeed on July 17.The cases have been registered in Lahore, Gujranwala and Multan for collection of funds for terrorism financing through assets/properties made and held in the names of Trusts/Non Profit Organisations (NPO) including Al-Anfaal Trust, Dawatul Irshad Trust and Muaz Bin Jabal Trust.According to the CTD, investigation was launched into financing matters of proscribed organisations - Jammat-ud-Dawah (JuD) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) - in connection with implementation of UN sanctions against these designated entities and persons as directed by NSC (National Security Committee) in its meeting of January 1, 2019 chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan for implementing the National Action Plan.\"These suspects made assets from funds of terrorism financing. They held and used these assets to raise more funds for further terrorism financing. Hence, they committed multiple offences of terrorism financing and money laundering under Anti Terrorism Act 1997. They will be prosecuted in ATCs (Anti Terrorism Courts) for commission of these offences,\" the CTD said.On December 7, the ATC could not indict Saeed and others as one of the co-accused Zafar Iqbal was not produced before the court by the authorities. Saeed\\'s indictment comes amidst growing international pressure on Pakistan to rein-in terror groups operating from its soil and bring to justice terror group leaders like Saeed.In October, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) warned Pakistan that it will be blacklisted if it did not control terror funding by February next, voicing serious concern over the country\\'s failure to deliver on most of its 27 targets.The US Department of the Treasury has designated Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, and the US, since 2012, has offered a USD 10 million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice.Saeed-led JuD is believed to be the front organisation for the LeT which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people.ALSO READ |\\xa014% rise in sex crime reporting after MeToo movement: StudyALSO READ |\\xa0North Korea conducts another test at satellite launch site', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

According to one of the most important guideline, tourists must secure an entry-visa or an entry-permit in absence of visa-provision in their countries in co-ordination with respective agencies.Travellers must also carry a PCR test report conducted not more than 72 hours ago, proving that the person was COVID-19 negative.Along with the report, the person must have booking-documents for the hotel wherein they will stay for at least seven days in quarantine and also provide papers showing that he/she has insurance of $5,000.In addition to the above-mentioned conditions, the traveller must also undergo a PCR test at their own expense on the fifth day of being quarantined and if the result is positive, the person must stay in quarantine for as long as they do not test negative.The Ministry further said that the trekking or mountaineering agency must ensure travellers from Nepal against coronavirus for a sum of 100,000 NPR prior to applying for permits.Travel enthusiasts must also abide by all the protocols laid out by the Health Ministry.Meanwhile, eight-time Everest climber Pemba Sherpa criticised the new guidelines, saying there will be no trekkers and mountaineers in the upcoming season.\"They won\\'t come here to stay at a hotel for a week even after having a negative PCR report,\" Sherpa said while asking the government to review its decision.Nepal opened Mount Everest and other Himalayan peaks on July 30 after a nearly five-month closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic.All spring season expeditions that usually last from March to May were suspended in the wake of the pandemic.The government had halted the issuance of climbing permits for expeditions and cancelled issued permits for the spring season 2020 on March 13.An expedition to Everest usually takes 45 to 90 days, a short climbing window, depending on favourable weather, and generally falls after mid-May.(With agency inputs)', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

Authorities said they did not suspect terrorism.The crash near Times Square and Trump Tower shook the 750-foot (229-meter) AXA Equitable building, sparked a fire, and forced office workers to flee on elevators and down stairs, witnesses and officials said.Related Stories Australian helicopter \\'targeted by lasers\\' during South China Sea military exerciseIAF intensifies search to trace missing AN-32 aircraft; helicopters, police agencies roped in NASA\\'s Mars helicopter testing enters final phaseThe pilot was the only person aboard, and there were no other reports of injuries, authorities said.It was not immediately clear what caused the crash, or why the Agusta A109E was flying in a driving downpour with low cloud cover and in the tightly controlled airspace of midtown Manhattan. A flight restriction in effect since President Donald Trump took office bans aircraft from flying below 3,000 feet (914 meters) within a 1-mile (1.6 km) radius of Trump Tower, which is less than a half-mile (0.8 kilometers) from the crash site.\"There\\'s something mysterious here,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNN, saying officials were scrutinizing video of a \"very erratic\" flight and authorities needed to find out more about the pilot at the time he decided to take off.The pilot, identified by his employer as Tim McCormack, was a former fire chief in upstate Clinton, New York. With 15 years of experience flying helicopters and single-engine airplanes, he was certified as a flight instructor last year, according to Federal Aviation Administration records.The East Clinton Volunteer Fire Department posted on Facebook that McCormack\\'s \"technical knowledge and ability to command an emergency were exceptional.\"The 19-year-old helicopter was linked to a real estate company founded by Italian-born investor Daniele Bodini, according to FAA records.The helicopter went down about 11 minutes after taking off from a heliport along the East River, a little more than a mile (1.6 km) away. Police Commissioner James O\\'Neill said it may have been returning to its home airport in Linden, New Jersey.The director at Linden Municipal Airport, Paul Dudley, described McCormack as \"a highly seasoned\" and \"very well regarded\" pilot who was a regular at the airfield.He suspects that a mechanical problem or the weather \"overwhelmed him and the helicopter,\" Dudley said. \"I believe he tried to get on the roof and spare the people on the ground.\"McCormack, 58, chronicled some of his helicopter flights on his Facebook page, including a 2014 emergency landing caused by a bird strike. He had been conducting a sightseeing tour over Manhattan when the bird penetrated the windshield of his Bell BHT 407, causing McCormack to land unexpectedly at the West 30th Street Heliport.\"It was pretty much like an explosion going off in your cockpit,\" McCormack told television station WABC at the time.The crash happened shortly before 2 p.m. Monday, when clouds obscured the roof of the building. Rescue vehicles swarmed to the scene a few blocks from Rockefeller Center.Pedro Rodriguez, a pastry line cook at Le Bernardin, a well-known restaurant in the AXA Equitable building, said workers got an announcement telling everyone to exit, and he later heard from people around him that there was a fire on the roof.The evacuation was not chaotic, Rodriguez said, but he was rattled because he immediately thought of the Sept. 11 attacks.\"It\\'s scary when something like this happens,\" he said.Videos posted by onlookers showed emergency vehicles in the street, but no obvious damage to the skyscraper. The fire department later tweeted a photo of the helicopter\\'s wreckage that showed piles of burned debris on the roof.\"If you\\'re a New Yorker, you have a level of PTSD, right, from 9/11. And I remember that morning all too well. So as soon as you hear an aircraft hit a building, I think my mind goes where every New Yorker\\'s mind goes,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters.Working for a bank on the building\\'s seventh floor, Kendall Sawyer felt a shake \\x97 \"jarring enough to notice,\" but workers weren\\'t sure what it was, she said.Then came an announcement that the situation was being looked into, and a few minutes later, an instruction to evacuate, without explanation, she said.\"It was a little bit crazy, a little bit scary\" as workers walked down the stairs, she said.A block south, lawyer Lance Koonce heard a loud sound he thought could be a low-flying helicopter. From his 21st-story window, he looked up and saw smoke.\"I couldn\\'t tell if the smoke preceded the helicopter coming over, or if it was from the helicopter crashing into the building,\" he said.Trump tweeted from Washington that he had been briefed on the crash. Cuomo\\'s office said the president and governor had spoken.The National Transportation Safety Board was sending an investigator.The city currently allows helicopters to take off and land from three heliports, one each on the East and West sides and in downtown Manhattan. All of the facilities border rivers.It was once more common for helicopters to take off from private Manhattan rooftops, the most famous of which was on the tower then known as the Pan Am building. In 1977, four people waiting on the roof were killed when a helicopter toppled over and a rotor blade broke off and hit them. A fifth person, a pedestrian, was killed by falling debris.That spurred a push to close down private helipads.Still, the city has seen a string of helicopter accidents since. The most recent was just last month, when a chopper crash landed in the Hudson River near a busy Manhattan heliport. The pilot escaped mostly unscathed.Five people died when a sightseeing helicopter crashed into the East River last year. Three people died in another crash into the same river in 2011. Back in 2009, a sightseeing helicopter collided with a small plane and killed nine people not far from the scene of Monday\\'s mishap.In 2006, New York Yankees pitcher Corey Lidle\\'s single-engine plane slammed into the 20th floor of a building on Manhattan\\'s Upper East Side, killing Lidle and his flight instructor. It was not clear which one was piloting the plane.The National Transportation Safety Board concluded the pilot misjudged a narrow U-turn before veering into the building.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if (\\'\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || \\'undefined\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

As president, Biden will work with Congress to increase the number of visas awarded for permanent, employment-based immigrationa\"and promote mechanisms to temporarily reduce the number of visas during times of high US unemployment.\"The argument for reducing the visas at times is similar to Trump\\'s rationale for freezing green cards and H1-B visas that cites the current high unemployment.Biden\\'s proposals on H1-B for highly skilled professional workers which is overwhelmingly held by Indians and on green cards, also has elements reflecting reforms and regulations proposed by Trump.The Plan says that to ensure that those getting H1-Bs do not compete for entry level jobs or work against recruiting workers already in the US, theAvisas would be linked to wages.The Plan said, \"High skilled temporary visas should not be used to disincentivise recruiting workers already in the U.S. for in-demand occupations. An immigration system that crowds out high-skilled workers in favor of only entry level wages and skills threatens American innovation and competitiveness.\"\"Biden will work with Congress to first reform temporary visas to establish a wage-based allocation process and establish enforcement mechanisms to ensure they are aligned with the labor market and not used to undermine wages,\" it added.This could make it difficult for many Indians to qualify for H1-B visas.A senior Trump official recently said that the president wants to link H1-B visas to wages so that instead of the current lottery system, the visas would be given out in order of the wages offered starting with the highest.Biden wants to exempt foreign students getting PhD degrees in science, engineering, technology and maths in the US from visa caps and automatically give green cards to those getting doctorates.\"Biden believes that foreign graduates of a US doctoral program should be given a green card with their degree and that losing these highly trained workers to foreign economies is a disservice to our own economic competitiveness,\" his plan said.He also wants to introduce a new category of immigrant visas that would be awarded through cities and local administrations facing shrinking populations and lacking entrepreneurs onAthe condition that those getting them settle in those areas.\"Biden will support a program to allow any county or municipal executive of a large or midsize county or city to petition for additional immigrant visas to support the region\\'s economic development strategy, provided employers in those regions certify there are available jobs, and that there are no workers to fill them,\" the Plan said.Where Biden diverges starkly from Trump is on other elements of immigration, especially those involving non-elites and refugees.The Plan said that it opposed a \"false choice\" between green cards for workers and those for family reunification, which Trump wants to severely limit while switching to a merit-based system.Applicants approved for family green cards will be given temporary visas under the programme and spouses and children of green card-holders will be exempt from limits on permanent resident visas, under the Biden Plan.The Plan will also simplify the process for green card-holders to get citizenship and eliminate roadblocks imposed by Trump such as making it harder for those who have availed of public benefits.Biden will also work with Congress to forge a system for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants to get citizenship, the Plan said.Other elements of the Biden plan include lifting the visa ban on some countries imposed by Trump and increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

One of the highest-ranking Indian-American civilians in the US Department of Defense, Iyer, who holds a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, serves as the principal advisor to the Secretary of the Army and directs representation of the secretary in matters relating to information management/information technology (IT), the Pentagon said in a statement.Equivalent in rank to a three-star General, Iyer will supervise an annual budget of USD 16 billion for the US Army's IT operations. Over 15,000 civilians and military personnel posted across 100 countries work under him.Iyer will direct the execution of policies and programmes to modernise the US Army to achieve digital overmatch against near peer adversaries such as China and Russia.The Army has committed to leveraging advanced technologies such as cloud computing, robotics and artificial intelligence as critical enablers for future war fighting through a concept called multi-domain operations.Previously, Iyer was partner and managing director at Deloitte Consulting LLP, where he led multiple technology programs supporting government clients.Over the course of his 26-year career, Iyer has supported a range of defence and commercial clients on a number of complex enterprise transformation challenges, including strategy, innovation and modernisation.He has established new organisations, including the first office of the Chief Technology Officer in the Army, co-founded a successful technology start-up, and led recovery programmes such as Obamacare. He also holds a patent and has published dozens of peer reviewed papers.Iyer holds a Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Arlington along with multiple masters degrees, including a Master of Business Administration from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from The University of Texas at Arlington.Iyer, originally a native of Tiruchirappalli in Tamil Nadu, grew up in Bengaluru and completed his undergraduate studies at National Institute of Technology Tirchi before moving to the US to pursue higher studies.In the US, he had barely enough money to pay for tuition and rent for one semester through his father's life savings, but was soon able to secure a full fellowship to complete all of his graduate education.His father Manakkal K Ganesan, an engineer working as General Manager at Metallurgical and Engineering Consultants (MECON), was instrumental in showing him a passion for public service and the value of education and hard work, according to a testimonial online.Iyer is married to Brindha, a healthcare IT programme manager in the US government. They have two sons, Ashwin Iyer, a freshman majoring in Data Science at the University of California at Berkeley, and Abishek Iyer, a 9th grader at Centennial High School in Maryland.\\xa0ALSO READ |\\xa0Joe Biden names Indian American Bharat Ramamurti as National Economic Council member\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

However, with the current censorship policy in the country, removal of any kind of content through non-transparent mechanisms, as in the case of the removal of Dawn.com\\'s post will make users inaccessible to information that comes in handy while making important electoral decisions.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

Milgrom, left on screen, and Robert B. Wilson have won the Nobel Prize in economics for \"improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats.\"\\xa0American economists Paul R Milgrom and Robert B Wilson on Monday won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Economics \"for improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats\". The Nobel Committee said that auctions are everywhere and affect \"our everyday lives\", adding that their discoveries have benefitted sellers, buyers and taxpayers around the world.The auction formats developed by the duo have been used to sell radio frequencies, fishing quotas and airport landing slots.The committee said Wilson\\'s work showed \\x93why rational bidders tend to place bids below their own best estimate of the common value,\\x94 that is, \\x93the value which is uncertain beforehand but, in the end, is the same for everyone.\\x94 \\x93(Bidders) are worried about the winner\\x92s curse \\x97 that is, about paying too much and losing out,\\x94 the committee said.Milgrom developed a more general theory of auctions that takes into account was is known as the \\x93private value\\x94 of what\\'s being sold that can vary greatly from bidder to bidder.Speaking to reporters in Stockholm by phone after learning of his win, Wilson struggled to think of an auction he himself had participated in. But then added: \\x93My wife points out to me that we bought ski boots on eBay. I guess that was an auction.\\x94Last year\\x92s award went to two researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a third from Harvard University, for their groundbreaking research into efforts to reduce global poverty.Few economists could have predicted last fall that the globe would come to a virtual standstill within months, as governments closed their borders, imposed lockdowns and ordered other measures to stop the spread of COVID-19, triggering a sharp dip in business activity worldwide.The winners were announced in Stockholm by Goran Hansson, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The prestigious award comes with a 10-million krona ($1.1 million) cash prize and a gold medal. The award caps a week of Nobel Prizes at a time when much of the world is experiencing the worst recession since World War II because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Technically known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, the award was established in 1969 and is now widely considered one of the Nobel prizes.Last week, the Nobel Committee awarded the prize for physiology and medicine for discovering the liver-ravaging hepatitis C virus. The prize for physics honoured breakthroughs in understanding the mysteries of cosmic black holes, and the chemistry prize went to scientists behind a powerful gene-editing tool. The literature prize was awarded to American poet Louise Glück for her \\x93candid and uncompromising\\x94 work.

      "[\"UK's post-Brexit visa strategy to benefit Indian students, professionals\", 'The UK government has unveiled its\\xa0post-Brexit\\xa0visas and immigration strategy that removes any cap on highly-skilled migrants, a proposal which is expected to benefit Indian students and professionals.', 'UK Home Secretary Sajid JavidThe UK government has unveiled its post-Brexit visas and immigration strategy that removes any cap on highly-skilled migrants, a proposal which is expected to benefit Indian students and professionals.The strategy, set out in an immigration White Paper, was tabled in the House of Commons on Wednesday by UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid.It removes any cap on highly-skilled migrants from anywhere in the world and improves the post-study work offering for international students.The proposals, set to be phased in from December 2021 after the proposed transition period for Britain\\'s exit from the European Union (EU), claim to level the country\\'s immigration playing field with the end of free movement for people from within the 28-member economic bloc.\"As we leave the European Union, free movement will end\\x85This will be a system where it is workers\\' skills that matter, not which country they come from,\" British Prime Minister Theresa May said in her foreword to the strategy.\"We are taking a skills-based approach to ensure we can attract the brightest and best migrants to the UK,\" added Javid, who made a reference to his own Pakistani origins as the \"son of immigrant parents\".Under the new proposals, an annual cap of 20,700 on the number of skilled work visas issued will be removed, likely to benefit doctors and IT professionals from India, among others.\\xa0There will also be a new 12-month visa route for workers at any skill level for a temporary period to allow businesses to hire the staff they need on a time-bound basis.\"People arriving on this route will not be able to bring family members with them, won\\'t accrue rights to settle in the UK and will have a 12-month cooling off period once their visa expires,\" the UK Home Office said.The onerous requirement for labour market tests by employers wanting to sponsor an overseas skilled worker are also to be done away with.The plans were broadly welcomed by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), which said the White Paper recognises the value offered by skilled workers from countries like India.\"Indian Industry has long called for a fair, transparent and skills-based immigration system, and today\\'s proposals go some way to achieving these goals,\\x94 said Jim Bligh, of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Chair of CII\\'s UK India Business Forum.\"Tackling the UK\\'s skills gaps, particularly in digital and technology, must remain a key focus for government and it is welcome that this paper recognises the value that skilled workers from overseas can bring to helping improve the UK\\'s skills base,\\x94 he said.Under changes proposed to attract international students to the UK, the government said it would \"improve the current offer\" to those who have completed a degree who want to stay on in the UK to work after they have completed their studies by offering six months\\' post-study leave to all Master\\'s students and Bachelor\\'s students studying at an institution with degree-awarding powers.\\xa0This is aimed at giving them more time to find permanent skilled work and to work temporarily during that period.\"We will also allow for students studying at Bachelor\\'s level or above to be able to apply to switch into the skilled workers route up to three months before the end of their course in the UK, and from outside of the UK for two years after their graduation,\" the White Paper notes.Universities UK International, the representative group for the country\\'s higher education institutions which has been campaigning for a better post-study offer, said the proposals recognise the important contributions made by international students to the UK.\"Allowing graduates to stay on for longer to find work in the UK sends the message that international students are welcome here, and we value the skills they bring. These changes will have a real, positive impact on the students who come here to study and their opportunities after graduating,\" said Vivienne Stern, Director of Universities UK International.However, the group added that it will continue to campaign for a longer two-year post-study work visa.As part of some of the more contentious aspects of the new immigration White Paper, the government will hold a consultation on a minimum salary requirement of 30,000 pounds for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas and low-skilled workers may be able to apply for short-term visas of up to a year.The document forms the basis for the Immigration and Social Security Coordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, to be published on Thursday, which ends free movement for EU nationals and creates the legal framework for a future UK borders and immigration system after Brexit.\\xa0It also creates parity in the way migrants can access the country\\'s benefits system, which will apply equally to both EU and non-EU nationals.The new system will be implemented in a phased approach from 2021, following an extensive 12-month programme of engagement with businesses, stakeholders and the public, the Home Office said.While it does not make a specific reference to the ruling Conservative Party\\'s manifesto pledge to bring immigration down to the tens of thousands annually, the government stressed that the target remains in place.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

Bernard Preynat, is accused of sexually abusing some 75 Boy Scouts went on trial Monday.\\xa0A French former priest accused of sexually abusing some 75 boys when he worked as their scout chaplain is on trial in Lyon, France\\'s worst clergy abuse drama to reach court so far.Church hierarchy is suspected of covering up Bernard Preynat\\'s actions for decades, and a French cardinal was convicted last year of failing to report him to police or prosecutors. The case\\'s repercussions reached all the way to the Vatican.Preynat has admitted to abusing boys in the 1970s and 1980s, and told the court Monday, \\x93I have heard the suffering of these people, which I\\'m guilty of causing. I hope that this trial can unfold as quickly as possible.\"The trial briefly opened Monday but was quickly delayed because of a lawyers\\' strike.The proceedings resumed Tuesday, though some lawyers pleaded for a new delay.Preynat, now 74, is charged with sexual assault of 10 minors between 1986 and 1991. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. He\\x92s also accused of abusing dozens of others in the 1970s and 1980s, but those alleged incidents happened too long ago to prosecute.Parents first alerted the diocese to alleged molestation by Preynat in 1991. The priest swore to the then-cardinal that he would no longer touch a child, and no other victims have come forward saying he abused them after 1991.He wrote a letter that year to the parents of a victim who wanted him to leave the Scout association he led, reading: \\x93I swear to you that since the start of the school year in September, absolutely nothing has happened between me and the children. (...) Everything that happened has shaken me up a lot and made me think. I am not trying to justify myself since I am wrong. Let me finish the year normally. \\x94At the time of the abuse, Preynat was in charge of the Saint-Luc scout camp in a private Catholic school in Sainte-Foy-les-Lyons in the suburbs of Lyon for 20 years, then continued his career as a priest until 2015 in the mountains near Lyon.In 2014, the priest was overtaken by his past. Alexandre Hezez, who said he had been abused as a child by Preynat, went public as an adult and asked church hierarchy why he was still in office. Other victims came forward too, one by one.It wasn\\'t until last year that the French Catholic Church found Preynat guilty of abuse and removed him from the priesthood.In defrocking him, the church said in a statement: \"In view of the facts and their recurrence, the large number of victims, the fact that Father Bernard Preynat abused the authority conferred on him by his position within the Scout group that he had founded (\\x85), the court decided to apply the maximum penalty (\\x85), namely the dismissal from the clerical state.\\x94That decision came after French Cardinal Philippe Barbarin was convicted in March of covering up for Preynat\\x92s actions. Barbarin tried to resign, but Pope Francis refused to accept it until the appeals process is complete. An appeals court ruling is expected Jan. 30.Several other church officials were also accused of failing to alert police or prosecutors, including a senior Vatican official, Cardinal Luis Ladaria. The Vatican invoked his immunity as an official of a sovereign state.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

It also offered to discuss the closure of a missile engine test site that would \\x93physically affirm\\x94 a move to halt the production of intercontinental range ballistic missiles and setting up working-level discussions for the return of U.S. war remains.However, the spokesman said the United States came up with a variety of \\x93conditions and excuses\\x94 to delay a declaration on ending the war.

The trip was Pompeo\\x92s third to Pyongyang since April and his first since the summit.Unlike his previous visits, which have been one-day affairs during which he has met with Kim Jong Un, Pompeo spent the night at a government guesthouse in Pyongyang and did not see the North Korean leader, although U.S. officials had suggested such a meeting was expected.

We stand ready to provide further support and assistance to the best of our capability in light of the needs of the Indian side.

Other deaths have occurred in France, Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the South Korean man, believed to be about 63 years old, died at a hospital on Wednesday and posthumously tested positive for the virus. Officials said he had been hospitalized due to schizophrenia for an extended period and recently suffered pneumonia symptoms.The center also confirmed 22 additional cases of the virus, raising the total in South Korea to 104.Twenty-one of those new cases were in and around the city of Daegu, where the mayor urged citizens earlier Thursday to stay home and wear masks even indoors if possible.In a televised news conference, Mayor Kwon Young-jin expressed fears that rising infections in the region will soon overwhelm the city\\x92s health system and called for urgent help from the central government.\\x93National quarantine efforts that are currently focused on blocking the inflow of the virus (from China) and stemming its spread are inadequate for preventing the illness from circulating in local communities,\\x94 Kwon said.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 49 of 73 new patients confirmed in the city\\x92s region in the past two days went to services at a Daegu church attended by a previously confirmed virus patient or contacted her elsewhere. That patient is a South Korean woman in her early 60s who has no recent record of overseas travel, according to center officials. She tested positive for the virus on Tuesday.The center\\x92s director, Jung Eun-kyeong, told reporters that it\\x92s still unclear whether she was a \\x93super spreader\\x94 of the disease or merely the first patient detected in the area. Jung said officials were screening some 1,000 people who attended services at the Shincheonji Church of Jesus with the woman on Feb. 9 and Feb. 16 and were placing them under home isolation.The church, which claims about 200,000 followers in South Korea, said it has closed all of its 74 sanctuaries around the nation and told followers to instead watch its worship services on YouTube.

The tousle-headed blond Johnson is one of Britain\\x92s best-known politicians, and one of the most prominent advocates for Brexit. Some euroskeptic lawmakers dream of replacing May with a staunch Brexiteer such as Johnson, a populist, polarizing figure who has never made a secret of his ambition to be prime minister.With Britain due to leave the currently 28-nation bloc on March 29, 2019, EU officials have warned Britain repeatedly that time is running out to seal a deal spelling out the terms of the divorce and a post-split relationship.Minutes after Johnson quit, May defended her Brexit plan to lawmakers in the House of Commons, with Johnson absent from his usual place on the Conservative front bench.She said she and the two departed ministers \\x93do not agree about the best way of delivering our shared commitment to honoring the result of the referendum\\x94 in which U.K. voters opted to leave the EU.May\\x92s plan seeks to keep the U.K. and the EU in a free-trade zone for goods, and commits Britain to maintaining the same rules as the bloc for goods and agricultural products.May said the plan would deliver frictionless trade with Europe and was the \\x93only way to avoid a hard border\\x94 between the U.K.\\x92s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. Britain and the EU agree there must be no tariffs and immigration checks along the currently invisible frontier, but working out how to achieve that has been a major stumbling block in negotiations.Rebuffing claims that her proposals make too many concessions to the EU, May said her \\x93smooth and orderly Brexit\\x94 would leave Britain free to make its own laws and trade deals.The resignations came just days after May announced she had finally united her quarrelsome government behind a plan for a divorce deal with the EU.Government unity began to fray within hours of Friday\\x92s announcement. Brexit-supporting lawmakers were angered by the proposals, saying they would keep Britain tethered to the bloc and unable to change its rules to strike new trade deals around the world. They also argued that the proposals breach several of the \\x93red lines\\x94 the government had set out, including a commitment to leave the EU\\x92s tariff-free customs union.In his resignation letter, Davis said the \\x93\\x92common rule book policy hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense.\\x94Johnson said in his letter that May\\x92s plan to keep close economic ties with the bloc means Britain is heading for a \\x93semi Brexit\\x94 that would leave Britain with the \\x93status of a colony\\x94 of the EU.Britain and the EU hope to reach broad agreement by October so the national parliaments of the remaining countries can ratify a deal before Britain leaves.

Steve Baker, a junior Brexit minister, resigned along with Davis. May appointed staunchly pro-Brexit lawmaker Dominic Raab as the country\\x92s new Brexit secretary.

Actor Yulia Peresild and director Klim Shipenko blasted off for the International Space Station in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft together with cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, a veteran of three space missions. Their Soyuz MS-19 lifted off as scheduled at 1:55 p.m. (0855 GMT) from the Russian space launch facility in Baikonur, Kazakhstan and successfully reached the designated orbit.Space officials reported that the crew was feeling fine and all spacecraft systems were functioning normally.Peresild and Klimenko are to film segments of a new movie titled \\x93Challenge,\\x94 in which a surgeon played by Peresild rushes to the space station to save a crew member who suffers a heart condition. After 12 days on the space outpost, they are set to return to Earth with another Russian cosmonaut.Speaking at a pre-flight news conference Monday, 37-year-old Peresild acknowledged that it was challenging for her to adapt to the strict discipline and rigorous demands during the training.\\x93It was psychologically, physically and morally hard,\\x94 she said. \\x93But I think that once we achieve the goal, all that will seem not so difficult and we will remember it with a smile.\\x94Shipenko, 38, who has made several commercially successful movies, also described their fast-track, four-month preparation for the flight as tough.\\x93Of course, we couldn\\x92t make many things at the first try, and sometimes even at a third attempt, but it\\x92s normal,\\x94 he said.Shipenko, who will complete the shooting on Earth after filming space episodes, said that Shkaplerov and two other Russian cosmonauts on board the station will all play parts in the new movie.Russia's state-controlled Channel One television, which is involved in making the movie, has extensively covered the crew training and the launch.\\x93I'm in shock. I still can't imagine that my mom is out there,\\x94 Peresild's daughter, Anna, said in televised remarks minutes after the launch.Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian state space corporation Roscosmos, was a key force behind the project, describing it as a chance to burnish the nation\\x92s space glory and rejecting criticism from some Russian media.Some commentators argued that the film project would distract the Russian crew and could be awkward to film on the Russian segment of the International Space Station, which is considerably less spacious compared to the U.S. segment. A new Russia lab module, the Nauka, was added in July, but it is yet to be fully integrated into the station.Once they arrive at the space station just over three hours after the launch, the three newcomers will join Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency, NASA astronauts Mark Vande Hei, Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Pyotr Dubrov and Aki Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.Novitskiy, who is set to star as the ailing cosmonaut in the film, will take the captain\\x92s seat in a Soyuz capsule to take the crew back to Earth on Oct. 17.ALSO READ:\\xa0Why did 145 Chinese air force planes violate Taiwan airspace in 4 days?

As seen in videos shared on social media, nearly six small fruits, contained in what looked like a blue plastic bag, flew over the head of the French leader and bounced off the shoulder and arm of two men beside him.\\xa0Someone in the crowd was overheard shouting \\x93projectile\\x94, while the bodyguards raised arms over the French leader\\x92s head to cover him.Someone then unfurled a partly broken black umbrella to shield Macron, while his security detail steered him to cover under a nearby market-stall parasol.The president sheltered there for a few moments until things calmed down.It was unclear whether Macron, who was making his first public appearance since his re-election on Sunday, was the target of the little tomatoes.\\xa0However, the French president was thereafter seen happily continuing his walkabout in Cergy-Pontoise, mingling and talking to people at the market while earnestly campaigning ahead of France\\x92s June legislative election.He told reporters he visited the working-class neighborhood as part of his previously stated pledge to unite France after the bruising presidential campaign.Macron wins French election -- What's next?\\xa0Macron comfortably beat far-right rival Marine Le Pen in Sunday\\x92s election runoff and is now looking to maintain his party\\x92s majority in the lower house of parliament.In his victory speech Sunday evening, he thanked the majority of French voters who chose him and vowed to lead a project for \\x93a stronger Europe.\\x94\\x93Europe is a framework for peace and stability. It\\x92s our safer asset for today and tomorrow,\\x94 he said at a campaign rally in Strasbourg, home to the European Parliament. \\x93Europe is what\\x92s protecting us from crisis and war.\\x94Boosted by his victory, Macron figures to be in the spotlight when he pays an expected visit to Berlin in the coming days to meet with new Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has had a low-profile debut on the international stage. French presidents traditionally make their first post-election trip abroad to Germany as a celebration of the countries\\x92 friendship after multiple wars.(With inputs from AP)Also Read |\\xa0Emmanuel Macron wins French Presidential election, beats far-right candidate Marine Le Pen\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

However, it had distanced itself from the recent high voltage political tussle between Shehbaz Sharif and Khan, saying it has nothing to do with politics.\"Imran Khan was so desperate that he, till his last minutes in power, had begged the establishment to save his government. He even had requested former president and PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari to help him in the wake of a no-confidence motion against him,\" Maryam said at a workers\\' convention in Lahore late Tuesday night.The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader was referring to Khan\\'s desperate efforts to delay the vote on no-confidence against him till the Supreme Court opened midnight on April 10 and ordered him to let the constitutional process complete.Khan was removed as the prime minister on April 10 through a no-confidence vote moved by the Opposition in the National Assembly, becoming the first Pakistani premier to be ousted by Parliament in the coup-prone country.Maryam is tasked by her father and three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif to hold rallies, especially in Punjab to counter Khan\\'s public power shows.Sharif -- against whom several corruption cases were launched by the previous Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government led by Khan -- had left for London in November 2019 after the Lahore High Court granted him a four-week permission allowing him to go abroad for his treatment.The new PML(N)-led coalition government recently issued a new passport to Sharif, paving the way for his return to the country. The Sharif family, however, has declared that the decision on the return of the 72-year-old PML-N supremo will be taken at an appropriate time.Maryam said told the charged workers that the days of trouble for Khan had begun. \"Imran Khan is crying that Nawaz Sharif has ended his government while sitting in London.

      "['Russia-Ukraine War: What are sanctions, do they ever work? Could they stop Russia\\x92s invasion of Ukraine?', 'The US and the UK have introduced unilateral sanctions targeting Russia\\x92s two largest banks, Sberbank and VTB Bank. They have also frozen the assets and restricted travel of key Russian oligarchs. Canada and Australia have followed suit.', \"Russian President Vladimir Putin looks on as he visits the construction site of the National Space Agency in MoscowA key feature of the international community\\x92s response to Russia\\x92s aggression against Ukraine has been the adoption of sanctions. But what exactly are sanctions and how do they operate in practice? And most importantly, are they likely to have any meaningful impact?What are sanctions?Sanctions are coercive measures that can be applied to diplomatic, economic and cultural relations between states. Commonly non-military in nature, they are imposed by one state against another (unilateral sanctions) or by an international organisation, such as the United Nations (collective sanctions).Historically, measures have ranged from comprehensive sanctions to more targeted measures prohibiting trade in particular items, such as arms, timber, or diamonds.Some sanctions have circumscribed particular activities understood to benefit a target, such as diplomatic, sporting, and cultural relations, as well as travel.They have also targeted particular individuals and groups who pose a threat to peace and security, including political elites, rebel groups, or terrorist organisations.How do economic sanctions operate in practice?Economic sanctions are multidimensional. They tend to include travel bans and financial sanctions. Financial sanctions consist of targeted asset freezes and restrictions on a wide variety of financial markets and services.Where the financial sanction is an asset freeze, it is generally prohibited to deal with the frozen funds held by a designated person or entity. Funds are defined to include financial assets of every kind: cash, cheques, money orders, credit, debts, stocks and shares, interest, dividends, or other income from or generated by assets.The designation of targeted individuals and entities can occur on the basis of a national listing procedure.Or, this designation may happen as a result of a sanctions regime adopted by an international organisation, which is then implemented by its members.This twin-track approach is generally reflected in the sanctions practice of states which maintain \\x93consolidated lists\\x94.Separate \\x93consolidated lists\\x94 are kept for those individuals and entities listed on the basis of unilateral sanctions and those listed as a consequence of collective sanctions.Some international best practice exists regarding sanctions implementation, such as guidance by the G7 Financial Action Task Force. But compliance will always depend on individual countries and the particular features of domestic companies.Financial institutions, such as banks, will have in place automated procedures to filter incoming transactions before entering, and outgoing transactions before leaving their internal systems.Are economic sanctions effective?They can be. The impact on listed individuals and entities can be severe, as illustrated by the internationally litigated cases of Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council of the European Union or Nada v Switzerland (both cases in the context of financial counter-terrorism sanctions).However, the general effectiveness of economic sanctions is uncertain, not least because it is empirically difficult to measure it.According to Dursun Peksen, a sanctions expert at the University of Memphis, economic sanctions result in meaningful behavioural change in the targeted country about 40% of the time.Yet, as a recent study by the US government demonstrates, establishing clear causality is impossible.For example, a sanctioned country or individual may decide to change their behaviour for many reasons. Some of these changes may be unrelated to the sanctions.What sanctions are now applied against Russia?The international community has imposed a mix of economic and diplomatic sanctions, with countries acting both unilaterally and collectively.The US and the UK have introduced unilateral sanctions targeting Russia\\x92s two largest banks, Sberbank and VTB Bank. They have also frozen the assets and restricted the travel of key Russian oligarchs. Canada and Australia have followed suit.Germany has indicated it is abandoning the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, designed to double the flow of Russian gas direct to the country. Poland, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Estonia have closed their airspace for Russian airlines.As for collective sanctions, the UN Security Council will remain unable to impose any sanctions due to the veto power Russia holds as a permanent member. Indeed, Russia has already used this veto power to block a resolution condemning the invasion of Ukraine.The EU, on the other hand, has quickly introduced asset freezes and travel bans preventing listed individuals from entering or transiting through EU territory.EU sanctions now apply to 555 Russian individuals and 52 entities, including 351 members of the Russian State Duma who have backed the aggression against Ukraine.The EU has since moved to adopt further sanction packages, which include targeting President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov directly.Together with the US and the UK, the EU has also agreed to remove select Russian banks from the SWIFT banking system, the financial messaging infrastructure that links the world\\x92s banks.The Council of Europe in Strasbourg has also applied unprecedented diplomatic sanctions. It has suspended Russia from its rights of representation in the Committee of Ministers and in the Parliamentary Assembly.Are the sanctions likely to have any meaningful impact?Too early to say, but probably not in the short term. The unilateral and collective sanctions that have been applied are comprehensive. They have also been adopted swiftly. Some of the measures, such as targeting Putin and Lavrov personally, are unprecedented.On the other hand, significant gaps remain and pose a considerable risk of fragmentation.The example of Switzerland is a case in point. The Swiss government has voiced support for complementing EU sanctions. Yet, it has so far shied away from applying targeted asset freezes of those individuals listed by the EU, the US and other countries.As a New York Times analysis details, there is also a growing concern\\xa0Russian companies may evade sanctions by turning to cryptocurrency tools, including the so-called digital ruble and ransomware.\\xa0Also Read |\\xa0India abstains from voting in UNSC to call 'rare special emergency session'\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

The IHME (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation) forecast shows over 200,000 additional deaths. If we would follow the rules, in terms of wearing masks and not mixing, we could avoid a large percentage of those deaths,\\x94 Gates, the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, told CNN.In recent weeks, the US is experiencing record high cases, deaths and hospitalisations. \"I thought the US would do a better job handling it,\" said Gates, who in 2015 had warned the world of such a pandemic.\"Overall, when I did the forecasts in 2015, I talked about the deaths potentially being higher. So, this virus could be more fatal than it is. We didn\\'t get the worst-case. But the thing that has surprised me is that the economic impact in the US and around the world has been much greater than the forecasts that I made five years ago,\" he said.The COVID-19 has so far killed more than 290,000 people in the US.Gates said that his Foundation has been funding a lot of the research for the vaccines. \"We\\'re very agile. We\\'re a partner in a thing called CEPI, which is the second biggest funder after the US government,\" he said.\"So, in diagnostics, therapy and vaccines, we know where the science is, we know how the pieces need to come together in an urgent way. And so our expertise in infectious disease, which normally only relates to developing countries, applied to the entire world for this crisis,\" he added.The US need to help all of humanity, Gates said when asked of the executive order signed by President Donald Trump which prioritizes distribution of the vaccine to Americans before it goes to people in other countries.\"We want the world economy be going. We want to minimize the deaths. And, you know, the basic technology is a German company. And so blocking international sharing and cooperation has been disruptive and a mistake during this entire pandemic,\" he said.\"So, we need to ramp up the capacity of all the vaccines. There will be some additional ones approved in the months ahead that are easier to scale up the manufacturing. But the US has benefited from other countries\\' work care, and we shouldn\\'t be entirely selfish in how we go forward,\" he added.Responding to a question, Gates said that he will take the vaccine publicly as the former US president, Bill Clinton, George Bush and Barack Obama, have said to increase the confidence of the people in the vaccine.\"I will do the same. When it\\'s my turn -- I\\'m not going to budge, but when my turn comes up, I will visibly take the vaccine, because I think that it\\'s a benefit to all people to not be transmitting,\" he said.Gates said that access to the vaccine should be based on medical need, not wealth at all.\"After all, this epidemic has been awful in the way that it\\'s exacerbated inequities. It\\'s been worse for Hispanics, worse for blacks, worse for low-income service workers, multigenerational households, a number of things that mean that, in terms of picking who gets the vaccine, we better be using equity to drive all those decisions,\" he said.Despite the availability of the vaccine, Gates said that the next four to six months really call on Americans to do their best. \"Because we can see that this will end, and you don\\'t want somebody you love to be the last to die of coronavirus,\" he said.\"Certainly, mask-wearing has essentially no downside. They\\'re not expensive. Bars and restaurants in most of the country will be closed as we go into this wave. And I think, sadly, that\\'s appropriate. Depending on how severe it is, the decision about schools is much more complicated, because, there, the benefits are pretty high, the amount of transmission is not the same as in restaurants and bars,\\x94 Gates said.In response to another question, Gates said that the \"transition is complicating\" the fight against coronavirus pandemic.\"But the new administration is willing to rely on actual experts, and not attack those experts. They\\'re laying out clear plans. So, I think we will get through this in a positive way. I\\'m pleased with the people and the priority that the president-elect, Biden, and his team are bringing to bear on this problem,\\x94 he said.\"Biden\\'s doing his best to retain Francis Collins and Tony Fauci and add them to that strong group of people. These are people who are willing to admit when things aren\\'t going well and deliver tough messages, particularly about the next four to six months. And so I do think the US will not be one of the worst performers as the team comes into office,\" Gates said.\\xa0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

And As of now, there\\'s no change to that policy,\" the official said in response to a question.\"The purpose of the visit is to press for concrete cooperation from Pakistan to advance the Afghanistan peace process, and to encourage Pakistan to deepen and sustain its recent effort to crack down on terrorist and militants within its territory,\" the senior administration official told reporters during a conference call.The official noted that by extending the invitation to Khan to visit the White House, the US also want to send a message to Pakistan that the \"door is open to repairing relations\" and building an enduring partnership if Pakistan \"changes its policies\" with regard to terrorists and militants.From the US perspective, the President will be most interested in encouraging Pakistan to assist in the Afghanistan peace process. \"We\\'re hoping that the discussions are productive,\" the official said.Prime Minister Khan\\'s visit is an opportunity to incentivise Pakistan to use the full leverage and influence on the Taliban to advance the peace process in Afghanistan. \"We are calling on Pakistan for assistance in moving the peace process forward,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\"We do appreciate the initial steps that Pakistan has taken to facilitate this effort.

We will consider changing that suspension on certain items if Pakistan meets our security concerns both in Afghanistan and with regard to some of the externally focus groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.

Lights were used in similar fashion at other New York state landmarks including the World Trade Center, Niagara Falls and the Albany International Airport Gateway.Parades, picnics and lessons in history were offered Saturday to commemorate Juneteenth in the US, a day that carried even more significance after Congress and President Joe Biden created a federal holiday to observe the end of slavery.A new holiday was \\x93really awesome. It\\'s starting to recognise the African American experience,\\x94 said Detroit artist Hubert Massey, 63.\\x93But we still have a long way to go.\\x94In Detroit, which is about 80 per cent Black, students from University Prep Art & Design School dodged rain to repaint Massey\\'s block-long message, \\x93Power to the People,\\x94 which was created last year on downtown Woodward Avenue.The o\\' in \\x93Power\\x94 was a red fist in memory of George Floyd and other victims of excessive force by police, Massey said.\\x93We did the original,\" said Olivia Jones, 15, leaning on a long paint roller.\\x93It\\'s important that we return and share that same energy.\\x94Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, two months after the Confederacy had surrendered. It was about 2 1/2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves in Southern states.Biden on Thursday signed a bill creating Juneteenth National Independence Day. Since June 19 fell on a Saturday, the government observed the holiday Friday. At least nine states have designated it in law as an official paid state holiday, all but one acting after Floyd, a Black man, was killed last year in Minneapolis.In Galveston, the birthplace of the holiday, celebrations included the dedication of a 5,000-square-foot mural titled \\x93Absolute Equality.\\x94\\xa0Opal Lee, 94, who was at Biden\\'s side when he signed the bill, returned to Fort Worth, Texas, to lead a 2.5-mile walk symbolizing the 2 1/2 years it took for slaves in Texas to find out they had been freed.Officials in Bristol, Rhode Island, unveiled a marker that describes the seaport\\'s role in the slave trade. The marker was placed at the Linden Place Museum, a mansion built by Gen. George DeWolf, who was a slave trader. The Rhode Island Slave History Medallion organization raises public awareness about the state\\'s role in slavery.A street in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was renamed Saturday for civil rights activists Harry and Harriette Moore. Harry was credited with registering more than 100,000 Black voters. They were killed on Christmas Day 1951 - their 25th wedding anniversary - when a bomb exploded under their bed.The final scene of a movie about the couple, \\x93The Price For Freedom,\\x94 was also being shot.\\x93They were ordinary people who brought about extraordinary change, and we are privileged to pay tribute to them here in Broward County,\\x94 county Commissioner Dale V C Holness said before the event.Hundreds of people gathered for a free concert in New York\\'s Times Square organized by The Broadway League, the trade group for the Broadway entertainment industry.At dusk, the Empire State Building brightened the sky with red, black and green lights to mark the day as it turned to night.A Juneteenth parade was held in Evanston, Illinois, a Chicago suburb that is using tax revenue from marijuana sales to offer housing grants to Black residents for past discrimination and the lingering effects of slavery.Sacramento\\'s Black community has organized Juneteenth festivals for 20 years, and this year\\'s featured a parade, talent show, food fair, the reading of the Emancipation Proclamation and even a golf tournament.\\x93This is the first Juneteenth where it\\'s being recognized nationally and socially, by the masses and not just within the Black community,\\x94 organizer Gary Simon said.\\x93We\\'ve seen an uptick in non-Black folks coming here for the last several years, and I\\'m seeing the difference in just the conversations taking place today.\\x94\\xa0New York civil rights activist the Rev Al Sharpton offered a tough message during a speech at his National Action Network, saying Senate Republicans who voted unanimously to make Juneteenth a federal holiday should also support Democratic bills that change voting laws and make it easier to crack down on rogue police officers.\\x93The celebration of Juneteenth is not a party. The way to deal with Juneteenth now is to deal with where race is in 2021,\\x94 Sharpton said.In Portland, Maine, Joe Kings said his great-great-great-grandmother was enslaved. He has a picture of her on the wall of his auto detailing shop. As he has for years, Kings commemorated Juneteenth with barbecue for adults and activities for kids.\\x93It\\'s a little bit more celebratory knowing that it\\'s official,\" Kings said, referring to his annual tradition and the new holiday.\\x93I\\'m not saying we were in the closet about it, but now it\\'s more widely recognized - and more importantly understood.\\x94   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if (\\'\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || \\'undefined\\' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

The U.S. Embassy urged the government to \\x93engage seriously and urgently\\x94 with the demonstrators and condemned attacks on them.Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent weeks in the capital and across the Shiite south to demand sweeping political change. The protesters complain of widespread corruption, a lack of job opportunities and poor basic services, including regular power cuts despite Iraq\\x92s vast oil reserves.The protesters have focused their anger on Shiite political parties and militias, many of which have close ties to Iran . Across the south, they have attacked party and militia headquarters, setting some of them ablaze.In the Shiite holy city of Karbala, protesters attacked the Iranian Consulate earlier this week, hurling firebombs over its walls. Security forces killed at least three people as they dispersed the protest. Days earlier, masked men suspected of links to the security forces opened fire on a demonstration there, killing at least 18 people.Overnight, at least two protesters were killed in clashes with security forces near the provincial headquarters in the city, according to a protester and a medic who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions.In Baghdad, protesters clashed with security forces on a fourth bridge over the Tigris River after previous clashes forced the closure of three other spans, paralyzing much of the city. The protests have been centered in Tahrir Square, on the eastern bank of the Tigris, and the demonstrators have been trying to reach the Green Zone, which houses government offices and foreign embassies on the other side of the river.As protesters moved toward the Martyrs\\x92 Bridge, north of the other three, they passed near the central bank. Iraqi security forces were deployed in large numbers around the bank and evacuated employees, but the protesters did not target the building.Security and medical officials said at least 29 people were wounded after being hit with batons or exposed to tear gas on or near Martyrs\\x92 Bridge. They said a medic was killed near the Al-Ahrar Bridge, which has seen heavy clashes in recent days, and another was wounded. They spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.In Tahrir Square, family and friends called for the release of Siba al-Mahdawi, a 37-year-old activist and volunteer medic who was abducted over the weekend. Her brother, Ahmed al-Mahdawi, said she was taken by masked men dressed in black as she returned home from a protest Saturday. He said the family has received no word of her whereabouts since she vanished four days ago.\\x93She assumed responsibility for the family after our father died,\\x94 he said, adding that she had taken care of her mother and four younger siblings as they struggled to find steady work.The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad called on the government to \\x93engage seriously and urgently with Iraqi citizens who are demanding reform.\\x94\\x93We deplore the killing and kidnapping of unarmed protesters, threats to freedom of expression, and the cycle of violence taking place,\\x94 it said. \\x93Iraqis must be free to make their own choices about the future of their nation.\\x94Maj.

He said security forces are not using live ammunition but would arrest anyone trying to block roads or bridges.Umm Qasr, which houses a vital oil terminal and also is an entry point for food and basic goods, has been blocked for five days. Clashes broke out when security forces tried to reopen it Tuesday, with one protester killed and eight wounded.Security forces have killed at least 273 protesters in two major waves of demonstrations since early October, including four who died Wednesday of injuries suffered earlier. Iraq\\x92s leaders have promised reforms and early elections, but the process they laid out could take months, and the protests have only grown in recent days.Iraq has held regular elections since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein following the U.S.-led invasion of 2003, but they have been dominated by Shiite Islamist parties that have failed to deliver on promises to improve daily life. The protests pose the biggest challenge to the government since it declared victory over militants from the Islamic State group nearly two years ago.Internet access remained limited Wednesday after the government shut it down earlier this week. Netblocks, a civil society group that tracks internet restrictions, said usage dropped to 19% of normal levels overnight Tuesday before being partially restored.Netblocks said Wednesday that Iraq \\x93remains largely offline.\\x94 It said an earlier series of internet outages during protests last month had cost the country more than $1 billion.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

President Bhandari will administer the oath of office and secrecy to Oli at a ceremony at Shital Niwas on Friday at 2:30 pm local time.The president had asked the Opposition parties to come up with the support of majority lawmakers to form a new government by 9 pm on Thursday after Oli lost the vote of confidence in the House on Monday.Until Thursday, Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba, who got backing from CPN-Maoist Centre chairman Pushpakamal Dahal \"Prachanda\" was hopeful to get sufficient votes in the House to stake his claim as the next Prime Minister.But as Madhav Kumar Nepal took a U-turn after his last-minute meeting with Oli, Deuba\\'s dream to become the next Prime Minister was shattered. Oli will now have to take a vote of confidence at the House within 30 days, failing which, an attempt to form a government under Article 76 (5) of the Constitution would be initiated.The CPN-UML, headed by Oli, is the largest party with 121 seats in the 271-member House of Representatives. At present 136 votes are needed to form a majority government. If the parties fail to form a new government in line with Article 76 (5) or the Prime Minister elected under this provision fail to secure the vote of confidence again, the sitting Prime Minister can recommend the President to dissolve the parliament and announce the date to hold general elections within the next six months.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli\\'s move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival \\'Prachanda\\'.

India has also been urged to maintain 40-metre height above sea level while making spillways\\' gates of the Pakal Dul project besides clarifying the pattern and mechanism for the water storage and releases,\" Dawn quoted one of the participants of the meeting as saying.\"Similarly, Pakistan raised some technical concerns over design of the the Lower Kalnal hydropower project, requesting India to address them at the earliest,\" the report said.India was represented by a nine-member delegation of the Indian Water Commission led by Commissioner P K Saxena. Yesterday, Shah said Pakistan raised objections on the 1000MW Pakal Dul and the 48MW Lower Kalnai hydroelectric projects and a detailed discussion will be held during the talks.\"We had also raised concerns over construction of dams on Pakistani rivers and India did not bother about it and continued doing the same,\" Shah said, adding India will reply to Pakistan\\'s queries on the controversial water projects.Former Pakistan Indus Water Commissioner Syed Jamaat Ali Shah told PTI that the successive Pakistani governments had given much importance to its water disputes with India.\"India does not bother about Pakistan\\'s objections. It begins work on building hydro power projects on the Pakistani rivers and the Pakistani government raises objections afterwards. Unless the Pakistani government seriously takes up these matters with India it will not get relief,\" he said, adding that Pakistan also needs to plead its case in the World Bank.According to an official of the Pakistan Water Commission, Pakistan has been raising reservations over the designs of the two projects \\x97 1000MW Pakal Dul and 48MW Lower Kalnai hydroelectric projects on River Chenab \\x97 and would like India to either modify the designs to make them compliant to the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty or put the projects on hold until New Delhi satisfies Islamabad.\"The two sides will in talks also finalise the schedule of future meetings of the Permanent Indus Commission and visits of the teams of the Indus commissioners,\" he said.Pakistan has also challenged the discharge series of River Lower Kalnai at Dunadi for winter months and estimated permissible pondage of 0.38 cubic megametres compared to Indian design pondage of 2.74 cubic megametres.The Lower Kalnai project is on a left bank tributary of Chenab and can have gross storage of about 1,508 acre feet of water.The Indian delegation will return home tomorrow.India and Pakistan signed the Indus Waters Treaty in 1960 after nine years of negotiations, with the World Bank being a signatory.The water commissioners of Pakistan and India are required to meet twice a year and arrange technical visits to projects\\' sites and critical river head works, but Pakistan had been facing a lot of problems in timely meetings and visits.The last meeting of the Pakistan-India Permanent Indus Commission was held in New Delhi in March during which both the sides had shared details of the water flow and the quantum of water being used under the 1960 treaty.The treaty sets out a mechanism for cooperation and information exchange between the two countries regarding their use of the rivers.

      "['Taliban sweep into Afghanistan after Kabul fall; President Ashraf Ghani flees country', 'Taliban fighters deployed across Kabul, taking over abandoned police posts and pledging to maintain law and order during the transition.', 'Smoke rises next to the US Embassy in Kabul. Taliban fighters have entered the Afghanistan capital, tightening their grip on the country.The Taliban swept into Afghanistan\\x92s capital after the government collapsed and the embattled president joined an exodus of his fellow citizens and foreigners, signaling the end of a costly two-decade US campaign to remake the country. Heavily armed Taliban fighters fanned out across the capital, and several entered Kabul\\x92s abandoned presidential palace. Suhail Shaheen, a Taliban spokesman and negotiator, told The Associated Press that the militants would hold talks in the coming days aimed at forming an \\x93open, inclusive Islamic government.\\x94Earlier, a Taliban official said the group would announce from the palace the restoration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the formal name of the country under Taliban rule before the militants were ousted by US-led forces in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, which were orchestrated by al-Qaida while it was being sheltered by the Taliban. But that plan appeared to be on hold.Kabul was gripped by panic. Helicopters raced overhead throughout the day to evacuate personnel from the US Embassy. Smoke rose near the compound as staff destroyed important documents, and the American flag was lowered. Several other Western missions also prepared to pull their people out.Fearful that the Taliban could reimpose the kind of brutal rule that all but eliminated women\\x92s rights, Afghans rushed to leave the country, lining up at cash machines to withdraw their life savings. The desperately poor \\x97 who had left homes in the countryside for the presumed safety of the capital \\x97 remained in parks and open spaces throughout the city.Though the Taliban had promised a peaceful transition, the US Embassy suspended operations and warned Americans late in the day to shelter in place and not try to get to the airport.Commercial flights were suspended after sporadic gunfire erupted at the Kabul airport, according to two senior U.S. military officials. Evacuations continued on military flights, but the halt to commercial traffic closed off one of the last routes available for fleeing Afghans.Many people watched in disbelief as helicopters landed in the U.S. Embassy compound to take diplomats to a new outpost at the airport. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken rejected comparisons to the U.S. pullout from Vietnam. \\x93This is manifestly not Saigon,\\x94 he said on ABC\\x92s \\x93This Week.\\x94The American ambassador was among those evacuated, officials said. He was asking to return to the embassy, but it was not clear if he would be allowed to. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations.As the insurgents closed in, President Ashraf Ghani flew out of the country. \\x93The former president of Afghanistan left Afghanistan, leaving the country in this difficult situation,\\x94 said Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the Afghan National Reconciliation Council and a longtime rival of Ghani. \\x93God should hold him accountable.\\x94Ghani later posted on Facebook that he left to avert bloodshed in the capital, without saying where he had gone.As night fell, Taliban fighters deployed across Kabul, taking over abandoned police posts and pledging to maintain law and order during the transition. Residents reported looting in parts of the city, including in the upscale diplomatic district, and messages circulating on social media advised people to stay inside and lock their gates.In a stunning rout, the Taliban seized nearly all of Afghanistan in just over a week, despite the billions of dollars spent by the U.S. and NATO over nearly 20 years to build up Afghan security forces. Just days earlier, an American military assessment estimated that the capital would not come under insurgent pressure for a month.The fall of Kabul marks the final chapter of America\\x92s longest war, which began after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. A U.S.-led invasion dislodged the Taliban and beat them back, but America lost focus on the conflict in the chaos of the Iraq war. For years, the U.S. sought an exit from Afghanistan. Then-President Donald Trump signed a deal with the Taliban in February 2020 that limited direct military action against the insurgents. That allowed the fighters to gather strength and move quickly to seize key areas when President Joe Biden announced his plans to withdraw all American forces by the end of this month.After the insurgents entered Kabul, Taliban negotiators discussed a transfer of power, said an Afghan official. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the closed-door negotiations, described them as \\x93tense.\\x94It remained unclear when that transfer would take place and who among the Taliban was negotiating. The negotiators on the government side included former President Hamid Karzai, leader of Hizb-e-Islami political and paramilitary group Gulbudin Hekmatyar, and Abdullah, who has been a vocal critic of Ghani.Karzai himself appeared in a video posted online, his three young daughters around him, saying he remained in Kabul. \\x93We are trying to solve the issue of Afghanistan with the Taliban leadership peacefully,\\x94 he said.Afghanistan\\x92s acting defense minister, Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, did not hold back his criticism of the fleeing president. \\x93They tied our hands from behind and sold the country,\\x94 he wrote on Twitter. \\x93Curse Ghani and his gang.\\x94The Taliban earlier insisted that their fighters would not enter people\\x92s homes or interfere with businesses and said they would offer \\x93amnesty\\x94 to those who worked with the Afghan government or foreign forces. But there have been reports of revenge killings and other brutal tactics in areas of the country the Taliban have seized in recent days. Reports of gunfire at the airport raised the specter of more violence. One female journalist, weeping, sent voice messages to colleagues after armed men entered her apartment building and banged on her door.\\x93What should I do? Should I call the police or Taliban?\\x94 Getee Azami cried. It wasn\\x92t clear what happened to her after that.An Afghan university student described feeling betrayed as she watched the evacuation of the U.S. Embassy.\\x93You failed the younger generation of Afghanistan,\\x94 said Aisha Khurram, 22, who is now unsure of whether she will be able to graduate in two months. She said her generation was \\x93hoping to build the country with their own hands. They put blood, efforts and sweat into whatever we had right now.\\x94Sunday began with the Taliban seizing Jalalabad, the last major city besides the capital not in their hands. Afghan officials said the militants also took the capitals of Maidan Wardak, Khost, Kapisa and Parwan provinces, as well as the country\\x92s last government-held border post.Later, Afghan forces at Bagram Air Base, home to a prison housing 5,000 inmates, surrendered to the Taliban, according to Bagram district chief Darwaish Raufi. The prison at the former U.S. base held both Taliban and Islamic State group fighters.READ MORE:\\xa0Afghanistan: Gunfire breaks out at Kabul airport as Taliban takes control of capitalREAD MORE:\\xa0Taliban to declare Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan: Official', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

      "['US to ask Cuba to cut embassy staff by 60 per cent, say officials', 'The US request marks yet another major setback for relations between the United States and Cuba, two countries that only recently renewed diplomatic relations after a half-century of hostility.', 'The Trump administration is preparing to ask Cuba to withdraw 60 per cent of its diplomats from Washington, US officials said on Monday, in response to last week\\'s US move to cut its own embassy staff in Havana by a similar amount.The US request marks yet another major setback for relations between the United States and Cuba, two countries that only recently renewed diplomatic relations after a half-century of hostility. It comes as the US seeks to protect its own diplomats from unexplained attacks that have harmed at least 21 Americans in Havana with ailments that affected their hearing, cognition, balance and vision.The State Department is expected to announce the decision Tuesday, officials said, though they cautioned no decision was formalized until publicly announced. The officials weren\\'t authorized to discuss the plan publicly and requested anonymity.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson discussed the plan Monday with President Donald Trump, one of the officials said.Cuba has denied involvement in the attacks. Though Havana is likely to view the move as unwarranted retaliation, US officials said the goal wasn\\'t to punish the communist-run island, but to ensure both countries have a similar number of diplomats in each other\\'s capitals. The United States will formally ask Cuba to pull the diplomats, but won\\'t expel them forcefully unless Havana refuses, the officials said.Tensions between the two neighbors have been escalating amid serious US concern about the unexplained attacks on Americans in Havana.On Monday, The Associated Press reported that US spies were among the first and most severely affected victims. Though bona fide diplomats have also been affected, it wasn\\'t until US spies, working out of the embassy under diplomatic cover, reported hearing bizarre sounds and experiencing even stranger physical effects that the United States realized something was wrong, several individuals familiar with the situation said.The mysterious \"health attacks\" started within days of President Donald Trump\\'s election in November, the AP has reported. But it wasn\\'t until Friday that the United States ordered more than half its embassy staff to return home.Delivering a one-two punch to US-Cuba relations, the US last week also delivered an ominous warning to Americans to stay away from Cuba, a move that could have profound implications for the island\\'s travel industry. The US said that since some workers had been attacked in Havana hotels, it couldn\\'t assure Americans who visit Cuba that they wouldn\\'t suffer attacks if they stay in hotels there.Cuba had blasted the American move as \"hasty\" and lamented that it was being taken without conclusive investigation results. But several US lawmakers had said that move by Washington didn\\'t go far enough, because President Raul Castro\\'s government was being permitted to keep all of its diplomats in the US Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had called the one-sided action \"an insult\" in an AP interview.There was no immediate reaction from Cuba\\'s Embassy in Washington late Monday after word emerged that the US planned to ask Cuban diplomats to leave. Yet the move will bring the two countries closer to the chilly state of relations they endured for decades until 2015, when they restored formal ties and re-opened embassies in Havana and Washington.The US previously had roughly 50 American workers at its embassy in Havana, so the 60 percent reduction will bring the figure down to roughly 20. It wasn\\'t immediately clear late Monday how Cuban diplomats will have to leave Washington to bring the two countries\\' rosters to parity.In Friday\\'s travel warning urging Americans not to visit Cuba, the State Department confirmed earlier reporting by the AP that US personnel first encountered unexplained physical effects in Cuban hotels. While American tourists aren\\'t known to have been hurt, the US said they could be exposed if they travel to the island.\"Because our personnel\\'s safety is at risk, and we are unable to identify the source of the attacks, we believe US citizens may also be at risk and warn them not to travel to Cuba,\" the warning said.At least 21 diplomats and family members have been affected. The department said symptoms include hearing loss, dizziness, headache, fatigue, cognitive issues and difficulty sleeping. Until Friday, the US had generally referred to \"incidents.\" Tillerson\\'s statement ended that practice, mentioning \"attacks\" seven times; the travel alert used the word five times.Still, the administration has pointedly not blamed Cuba for perpetrating the attacks, and officials have spent weeks weighing how to minimize the risk for Americans in Cuba without unnecessarily harming relations or falling into an adversary\\'s trap.In 2015, President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro restored diplomatic ties, ordered embassies re-opened and eased travel and commerce restrictions. Trump has reversed some changes but has broadly left the rapprochement in place.To medical investigators\\' dismay, symptoms have varied widely. In addition to hearing loss and concussions, some people have experienced nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. The Associated Press has reported some now suffer from problems with concentration and common word recall.Though the incidents stopped for a time, they recurred as recently as late August.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimated that in 2005.', 'Twice as much food being wasted globally as thought: StudyConsumers around the world may be wasting more than twice as much food as commonly believed, according to a study. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimated that in 2005, one third of all food available for human consumption was wasted, researchers from Wageningen University and Research in the Netherlands noted. This figure has continued to serve as reference for the extent of global food waste, they said.However, the FAO methodology does not factor in consumer behaviour regarding food wastage, and considers food supply alone in determining the extent of food waste, the researchers said. The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, is the first to investigate if and how consumer affluence may affect food waste, they said.\"Novel research using energy requirement and consumer affluence data shows that consumers waste more than twice as much food as is commonly believed,\" said Monika van den Bos Verma from Wageningen University and Research.\"It provides a new globally comparable base against which one can measure progress on the international food waste target, and suggests a threshold level of consumer affluence around which to launch intervention policies to prevent food waste from becoming a big problem,\" Verma said.Using a human metabolism model and data from FAO, the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO, the researchers quantified the relationship between food waste and consumer affluence.Using this model, they created an international dataset providing estimates of global as well as country specific food waste. The researchers found that once consumer affluence reaches a spending threshold of about USD 6.70 per day per capita, consumer food waste starts to rise. The wastage increases rapidly with rising affluence at first, and then at much slower rates at higher levels of affluence, they said.The study also showed that FAO\\'s estimates of consumer food waste may be too low. While FAO estimated food waste to be 214 kilo calories per day (Kcal/day) per capita in 2015, the new model estimated food waste as 527 Kcal/day per capita for the same year. This work relies on the accuracy of FAO\\'s data, which may not always be complete. The researchers also noted there are many consumer attributes that may affect food wastage beyond affluence.However, the new study suggests that to achieve low global food waste, a joint focus on reducing high food waste levels in high income countries, and preventing waste levels from rising rapidly in lower-middle income countries -- where affluence is increasing -- may be needed. The researchers believe that the method behind this study can be used as a basis to introduce the affluence elasticity of waste as a new concept in future models. It may also help better understand and assess current food waste magnitudes, and help measure global progress in reducing food waste, they said.\\xa0ALSO READ | Haqqani network founder leader Jalaluddin Haqqani dead: Afghan Taliban ALSO READ | 1,716 Chinese medical staff infected with coronavirus', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

No Pakistani prime minister has ever completed a full five-year term in office.', 'Pakistan PM Imran Khan directs his party lawmakers to abstain from voting on no-confidence motionPakistan\\'s embattled Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday strictly directed his party lawmakers to either abstain or not attend the National Assembly session on the day of voting on the no-confidence motion against him, which is likely to be held in the first week of April. The instructions came a day after Pakistan\\'s opposition on Monday tabled the no-trust motion in the National Assembly against Khan, who is facing his toughest political test since assuming office in 2018 as defections in his party and cracks in the ruling coalition appeared to have made his position fragile.In a letter to the PTI lawmakers, Prime Minister Khan, who is the party\\'s chairman, said: \"All the members of the (PTI) in the National Assembly shall abstain from voting/not attend the meeting of the National Assembly on the date when the said resolution is set out on the agenda,\" Geo News reported.All members are \"required to adhere to his directions in true letter and spirit\" and should keep in mind the \"intention behind the provision of Article 63(A) of the Constitution of Pakistan,\" he said. Khan also warned the party lawmakers that \"every or any\" violation of the directions would be treated as an \"express defection\" in terms of Article 63(A).No prime minister in Pakistan\\'s history has ever been ousted through a no-confidence motion, and Khan is the third premier to face the challenge. The lower house will convene on Thursday to debate the motion. Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid has said that the voting on the no-confidence motion will be held on April 3.\"There will be a debate on the no-confidence motion on March 31, followed by voting on April 3,\" he said, adding that Khan would emerge victorious.Prime Minister Khan needs 172 votes in the house of 342 to foil the bid to topple his government. Since Khan\\x92s allies are still not committed to support him and about two dozen lawmakers from within the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf have revolted, the situation was still fluid.Meanwhile, the government said on Tuesday that it was willing to share a \"letter\" with the chief justice of the country which the prime minister waved at a rally as proof of a foreign \"conspiracy\" to topple him.In a massive show of strength, Khan on Sunday addressed a mammoth rally in the national capital where he claimed that foreign powers were involved in a conspiracy to topple his coalition government. He pulled a document from his pocket to exhibit it for the charged crowd, saying it was the letter sent to threaten him.Addressing a press conference along with Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, Minister for Planning Asad Umar claimed that he saw the letter himself and said that the prime minister was ready to share with the chief justice.\"Obviously, it is the highest office of justice in Pakistan, it is a huge position that has respect in this country. Personally too, the chief justice has a very good reputation. The prime minister said that if necessary, and for the people\\'s satisfaction, he is ready to present the letter to the chief justice of the Supreme Court,\" Umar said.Umar said that the letter was written before the no-confidence motion submitted against the prime minister on March 8 but it clearly mentioned the no-trust move which makes it a matter of concern.\"So it is clear that the foreign hand and no-confidence motion are linked. These are not two separate things and we see a clear connection between them,\" said Umar.He, however, refused to make the contents public and even sharing it with the opposition as demanded by its leaders. But he said that the letter had been shared with the top civil and military leadership and a few members of the cabinet.Umar also said that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who is living in London, was one of the \"characters\" mentioned in the letter that was a testimony of the conspiracy to topple the government. Information minister Chaudhry claimed that Sharif had held meetings with Israeli diplomats. \"This is why I was saying that he should not be allowed to go abroad, because when such people go abroad they become a stooge, a weapon of the international establishment,\" he said.The presser by the two ministers came after the opposition accused the prime minister for faking up the letter and asked the government to share it. \"If there is real threat from abroad to the security of the country, then we are with the government,\" Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Ahsan Iqbal said.Former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi asked the government to summon a session of parliament on Wednesday and share the letter with the lawmakers.\"A threat has been made to our country and we have to respond to it collectively. This is not just about Imran Khan and his two ministers,\\x94 he said. He asserted that the prime minister should either take the parliament into confidence over the letter or apologize.The development comes a day after the opposition alliance in a power show on Monday night vowed to bring down the government of Khan. The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), which among others include PML-N and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-I), organised a big rally on the Srinagar Highway in Islamabad.PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz, daughter and heir of former premier Nawaz Sharif, accused Khan of putting down his most trusted Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar to save his power after the government decided to replace him with Chaudhry Pervez Elahi to win the support of his Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid party, which has five lawmakers in the lower house.Khan came to power in 2018 with promises to create a \\x91Naya Pakistan\\x92 but miserably failed to address the basic problem of keeping the prices of commodities in control, giving air to the sails of opposition ships to make war on his government.

Doctors diagnosed the patient with hard-metal pneumoconiosis, a rare form of lung disease that causes irreparable damage, persistent coughing and breathing issues. It is typically diagnosed in people who work with \\'hard metals\\', such as cobalt or tungsten, in jobs like tool sharpening, diamond polishing or making dental prosthetics.According to the study, published in the European Respiratory Journal, this is the first known case where the disease has been linked to vaping.\"Hard-metal pneumoconiosis is diagnosed by looking at a sample of the patient\\'s lung tissue under the microscope. It has a distinctive and unusual appearance that is not observed in other diseases. When we diagnose it, we are looking for occupational exposure to metal dust or vapour, usually cobalt, as a cause,\" said study researcher Kirk Jones from University of California in the US.\"This patient did not have any known exposure to hard metal, so we identified the use of an e-cigarette as a possible cause,\" Jones said.Hard-metal pneumoconiosis causes damaged lung cells to engulf other cells and form \\'giant\\' cells that can be seen clearly under a microscope.It can result in permanent scarring in patients\\' lungs with symptoms such as breathing difficulties and chronic coughing.This scarring cannot be cured, although some patients may have mild improvement if the exposure to hard-metal dust stops and they are treated with steroids.When researchers tested the patient\\'s e-cigarette, a personal vaping device used with cannabis, they found cobalt in the vapour it released, as well as other toxic metals - nickel, aluminium, manganese, lead and chromium.Previous research has also found these metals in vapour from other e-cigarettes and researchers say they believe the metals are coming from the heating coils found in vaping devices, rather than from any particular type of re-fill.\"Exposure to cobalt dust is extremely rare outside of a few specific industries. This is the first known case of metal-induced toxicity in the lung that has followed from vaping and it has resulted in long-term, probably permanent, scarring of the patient\\'s lungs,\" said Indian-origin researcher and study co-author Rupal Shah from the University of California.\"We think that only a rare subset of people exposed to cobalt will have this reaction, but the problem is that the inflammation caused by hard metal would not be apparent to people using e-cigarettes until the scarring has become irreversible, as it did with this patient,\" Shah added.\"E-cigarettes are harmful, they cause nicotine addiction and can never substitute for evidence-based smoking cessation tools,\" said Jorgen Vestbo, Professor at University of Manchester in UK.\"The medical profession as well as the public should be concerned about a new wave of lung diseases caused by a product which is heavily promoted by the tobacco industry,\" Vestbo said.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

Confusion reigned after the quarantine was announced, with residents and tourists from Venice to Milan trying to figure out how and when the new measures would take effect. Travelers crammed aboard standing-room-only trains, tucking their faces into scarves and sharing sanitizing gel.After mass testing uncovered more than 7,300 infections, Italy\\'s outbreak surged to nearly equal South Korea\\'s, which had been tapering off, and trailing China, where COVID-19 is in retreat.

The 26th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team concerning ISIL, al-Qaida and associated individuals and entities said that in April and May, the Afghan special forces conducted a series of countrywide operations and arrested the head of the ISIL-K Aslam Farooqi (also known as Abdullah Orokzai) and his predecessor Zia ul-Haq (also known as Abu Omar Khorasani) and others.Farooqi, who hails from Pakistan\\x92s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, is the mastermind behind the deadly terror attack on a prominent gurudwara in Kabul in March that killed 25 Sikhs. He is not blacklisted by the UN Security Council\\x92s 1267 al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee. Similarly, Haq is also a Pakistani national and has not been blacklisted yet. Al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) operates under the Taliban umbrella from Afghanistan\\x92s Nimruz, Helmand and Kandahar provinces and its current leader is Pakistan-born Osama Mahmood, who is also \\x93not listed\\x94 under the UNSC sanctions. Mahmood succeeded Asim Umar. The report said that the group reportedly has between 150 and 200 members from Bangladesh, India, Myanmar and Pakistan and \\x93is reportedly planning retaliation operations in the region to avenge the death of its former leader.\\x94The Sanctions Monitoring Team report said that the \"large terrorist group present in Afghanistan\\x94 Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is led by Amir Noor Wali Mehsud. Pakistan-born Mehsud was designated a global terrorist by the UNSC sanctions committee only this month, more than two years after he was named the TTP leader, following the death of former TTP head Maulana Fazlullah. Mehsud is supported by his deputy Qari Amjad and TTP spokesperson Mohammad Khorasani, both not listed under the UNSC sanctions. This demonstrates that the Pakistani nationals operate at leadership levels in the terror organisations and point to the terror groups\\x92 Pakistani links.The report said that al-Qaida is covertly active in 12 Afghan provinces and its leader Aiman al-Zawahiri remains based in the country. The monitoring team estimates the total number of al-Qaida fighters in Afghanistan between 400 and 600. The leadership maintains close contact with the Haqqani Network. In February 2020, al-Zawahiri met with Yahya Haqqani, \\x93the primary Haqqani Network contact with al-Qaida since mid-2009, to discuss the ongoing cooperation.\\x94\\xa0(With inputs from PTI)', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

More than 100,000 people were left homeless in the aftermath, adding to the fear in Goma on Saturday night.\\x93We are already in a total psychosis,\\x94 resident Zacharie Paluku told The Associated Press. \\x93Everyone is afraid; people are running away. We really don\\x92t know what to do.\\x94Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi said he would be returning home on Sunday from Europe earlier than planned in order to help coordinate relief efforts.The government said an evacuation plan was being activated, but the official announcement came several hours after the sky turned a fiery red, and many already had fled on foot in hopes of crossing the Rwandan border post just outside town. Car horns honked and motorcycle taxis weaved as people attempted to escape in panic.Rwandan immigration authorities reported that some 3,000 people already had officially crossed over from Congo to escape the volcano\\x92s eruption, according to the national broadcaster.The U.N. peacekeeping mission known as MONUSCO tweeted dramatic footage of the city alit, saying it was conducting reconnaissance flights over Goma where it maintains a large base.\\x93The lava doesn\\x92t seem to be headed toward the city of Goma. We remain on alert,\\x94 it said.Some sought refuge aboard boats on Lake Kivu, while others fled to Mount Goma, the highest point in the metropolitan area.

The two volcanos are located about 13 kilometers (8.1 miles) apart.Volcanologist Charles Balagizi said the observatory\\x92s report was based on the direction in which the lava appeared to be flowing, which was toward Rwanda rather than Goma.Goma sits along the border between Congo and neighboring Rwanda, and is a regional hub for many humanitarian agencies in the region, as well as the U.N. peacekeeping mission known as MONUSCO.The volcano erupting is also close the Virunga National Park, home to some of the last mountain gorillas in the world. While Goma is home to many U.N. peacekeepers and aid workers, much of the surrounding eastern Congo is also under threat from a myriad of armed groups vying for control of the region\\x92s mineral resources.ALSO READ:\\xa0?At least 2,000 housing units destroyed in fighting between Israel and Palestinian militant groups', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

From Balochistan to PoK, China has stationed its troops to serve its various purposes. Now, China appears to be hell-bent on increasing its presence around Nepal as well. Recent reports say that China has increased deployment of troops at India-Nepal-China tri-junction near Lipulekh.Lipulekh is tri-junction between India, Nepal and China situated atop the Kalapani Valley in Uttarakhand.Sources said that China has deployed 150 Light Combined Arms Brigade. The brigade was moved in two weeks ago from Tibet towards the Lipulekh tri-junction in China.The Indian authorities have came to know two weeks ago that Chinese troops were reinforced in Pala, around 10 km from the border.In July itself, around 1,000 troops were deployed near Pala and a permanent post was built there by China. \"A fortnight back, 2,000 more additional troops were deployed at the post,\" sources said.India\\'s road construction to Lipulekh lake at 17,000 feet had sparked a diplomatic row between the India and Nepal as Kathmandu claimed the area to be its territory. The road will shorten the travel time for pilgrims visiting the Kailash Mansarovar. Nepal also brought out a new political map showing the contested area as its own.India and China are locked in a more than three-month-long standoff at multiple points, hitherto unprecedented along the border.China had changed the status quo on the Line of Actual Control at various places, moving inside Indian territories. India has objected to it and is taking up the matter with China at all levels.China has built up troops, artillery and armour in three sectors of Line of Actual Control -- western (Ladakh), middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal) and eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal).The border tension between India and China has not been resolved despite several rounds of military and diplomatic talks. China\\'s commitment for disengagement at the border in Eastern Ladakh remains unsatisfactory and India has directed its armed forces to prepare for a long haul.(With IANS input)', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)South Korea\\x92s capital closed down more than 2,100 bars and other nightspots Saturday because of a new cluster of coronavirus infections, Germany scrambled to contain fresh outbreaks at slaughterhouses, and Italian authorities worried that people were getting too friendly at cocktail hour during the country\\x92s first weekend of eased restrictions.The new flareups \\x97 and fears of a second wave of contagion \\x97 underscored the dilemma authorities face as they try to reopen their economies.Around the world, the U.S. and other hard-hit countries are wrestling with how to ease curbs on business and public activity without causing the virus to come surging back.In New York, the deadliest hot spot in the U.S., Gov. Andrew Cuomo said three children died from a possible complication of the coronavirus involving swollen blood vessels and heart problems. At least 73 children in the state have been diagnosed with symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease \\x97 a rare inflammatory condition \\x97 and toxic shock syndrome. But there is no proof the mysterious syndrome is caused by the virus.A Cuomo spokesman said the governor was extending stay-at-home restrictions to June 7, but another top aide later clarified that that was not so; the May 15 expiration date for the restrictions remains in place \\x93until further notice,\\x94 Melissa DeRosa said in an evening statement.Elsewhere, Belarus, which has not locked down despite increasing case numbers, saw tens of thousands turn out to mark Victory Day, the anniversary of Nazi Germany\\x92s defeat in 1945. That was in contrast to Russia, which skipped the usual grand military parade in Red Square.Worldwide, 4 million people have been confirmed infected by the virus, and more than 275,000 have died, including over 78,000 in the U.S., according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Spain, France, Italy and Britain have reported around 26,000 to 32,000 deaths each.Germany and South Korea have both carried out extensive testing and contact tracing and have been hailed for avoiding the mass deaths that overwhelmed other countries. But even there, authorities have struggled to find the balance between saving lives and salvaging jobs.Seoul shut down nightclubs, hostess bars and discos after dozens of infections were linked to people who went out last weekend as the country relaxed its social-distancing guidelines. Many of the infections were connected to a 29-year-old man who visited three nightclubs before testing positive.Mayor Park Won-soon said health workers were trying to contact some 1,940 people who had been at the three clubs and other places nearby. The mayor said gains made against the virus are now threatened \\x93because of a few careless people.\\x94Health officials in Germany faced outbreaks at three slaughterhouses in what was seen as a test of the government\\x92s strategy for dealing with any resurgence of the virus during the easing of the restrictions. At one slaughterhouse, in Coesfeld, 180 workers tested positive.Businesses in the U.S. continue to struggle as more employers are realizing their laid off employees might not return to work anytime soon. U.S. health officials are watching for a second wave of infections, roughly two weeks after states began gradually reopening with Georgia largely leading the way.Some malls have opened up in Georgia and Texas, while Nevada restaurants, hair salons and other businesses were able to have limited reopenings Saturday or once again allow customers inside their establishments after nearly two months of restrictions.Meanwhile some national parks have started testing out public access. The reopening of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park along the Tennessee-North Carolina border was a bit too tempting a draw Saturday as scores of nature lovers crowded parking lots and trails and even trekked into closed areas, park spokeswoman Dana Soehn said. Many did not wear masks.Italy saw people return to the streets for their traditional aperitivos and revel in fine weather as restrictions there were eased, alarming some public officials.Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala warned that \\x93a handful of crazy people\\x94 were putting the city\\x92s recovery at risk and threatened to shut down the trendy Navigli district after crowds of young people were seen out at aperitivo hour ignoring social-distancing rules.In Rome, the Campo dei Fiori flower and vegetable market was bustling Saturday morning, the first weekend Italians were allowed outside for more than just work and necessities.But confusion about what is now allowed and what is not created frustration for business owners.Carlo Alberto, owner of the TabaCafe, an Argentine empanada bar that was selling cocktails to a few customers, said that since reopening this week he had been threatened with a fine by the police because of the crowds in front of his bar.\\x93Am I supposed to send them home? They need a guard here to do that,\\x94 he said. \\x93The laws aren\\x92t clear, the decree isn\\x92t clear. You don\\x92t know what you can do.\\x94In the U.S., the head of the Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn, put himself in quarantine after coming into contact with an infected person. And the government said it is delivering supplies of remdesivr, the first drug shown to speed the recovery of COVID-19 patients, to six more states. Seven states were sent cases of the medicine earlier in the week.Elsewhere, Pakistan allowed shops, factories, construction sites and other businesses to reopen Saturday, while more than 1,600 new cases and 24 deaths were reported. Prime Minister Imran Khan said the government is rolling back curbs because it can\\x92t support millions of families that depend on daily wages.The government warned that controls will be reimposed if the public fails to follow social-distancing guidelines.In Spain, health authorities will allow certain regions to scale back their lockdowns starting Monday, with limited seating at bars, restaurants and other public places. But Madrid and Barcelona, the country\\x92s largest cities, both badly hit by the scourge, will remain shut down.\\x93The pandemic is evolving favorably, but there is a risk of another outbreak that could generate a serious catastrophe,\\x94 Spanish health official Fernando Simón said. \\x93Personal responsibility is vital.\\x94This year\\x92s observance of Victory Day in Russia had been expected to be especially large because it is the 75th anniversary. Instead, Vladimir Putin laid flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier, and a show of military might was limited to a flyover of 75 warplanes and helicopters.Belarus, though, held a military parade in front of big crowds in the capital, Minsk, despite sharply rising coronavirus infections. Belarus has not imposed restrictions to halt the virus\\x92 spread, and authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has dismissed concerns about it as a \\x93psychosis.\\x94\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

This is an important finding that requires confirmation in prospective clinical trials, Gilead said on Friday about the results presented at the virtual COVID-19 conference as part of the 23rd International AIDS Conference.The analysis included 312 patients treated in the Phase-3 SIMPLE-Severe study and a separate real-world retrospective cohort of 818 patients with similar baseline characteristics and disease severity who received standard of care treatment in the same time period as the SIMPLE-Severe study.Patients were primarily located in North America (92 per cent, remdesivir cohort vs. 91 per cent, standard-of-care cohort), Europe (5 per cent vs. 7 per cent) and Asia (3 per cent vs. 2 per cent).The analysis demonstrated that remdesivir treatment was associated with significantly improved clinical recovery and a 62 percent reduction in the risk of mortality compared to standard of care.Findings from the comparative analysis showed that 74.4 per cent of remdesivir-treated patients recovered by Day 14 versus 59 per cent of patients receiving standard of care.The mortality rate for patients treated with remdesivir in the analysis was 7.6 per cent at Day 14 compared with 12.5 per cent among patients not taking remdesivir.\"This comparative analysis provides valuable additional information regarding the benefit of remdesivir compared with standard of care alone,\" Susan Olender of Columbia University Irving Medical Center said in a statement.\"While not as vigorous as a randomized controlled trial, this analysis importantly draws from a real-world setting and serves as an important adjunct to clinical trial data, adding to our collective understanding of this virus and reflecting the extraordinary pace of the ongoing pandemic.\"The results of this comparative analysis add to the previously presented National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, which showed that remdesivir shortened time to recovery by an average of four days as compared to placebo -- 11 vs. 15 days.In the NIAID study, patients taking remdesivir trended toward lower mortality compared with those in the placebo group, but this result did not reach statistical significance --7.1 percent vs. 11.9 per cent.Due to the current public health emergency, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe Covid-19.\"These data presented at the Virtual COVID-19 Conference shed additional light on the use of remdesivir in specific patient populations, including those that may be susceptible to higher rates of COVID-19 infection, as well as others that are particularly vulnerable, including children and pregnant and postpartum women,\" said Merdad Parsey, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Gilead Sciences.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

He asserted that a \"barrier or walls will be an important part of the solution.\"The deal includes back pay for some 800,000 federal workers who have gone without paychecks. The Trump administration promises to pay them as soon as possible.Also expected is a new date for the president to deliver his State of the Union address, postponed during the shutdown. But it will not be Jan. 29 as once planned, according to a person familiar with the planning but unauthorized to discuss it.As border talks resume, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he hopes there will be \"good-faith negotiations over the next three weeks to try to resolve our differences.\"Schumer said that while Democrats oppose the wall money, they agree on other ways to secure the border \"and that bodes well for coming to an eventual agreement.\"In striking the accord, Trump risks backlash from conservatives who pushed him to keep fighting for the wall. Some lashed out Friday for his having yielded, for now, on his signature campaign promise.Conservative commentator Ann Coulter suggested on Twitter that she views Trump as \"the biggest wimp\" to serve as president.Money for the wall is not at all guaranteed, as Democrats have held united against building a structure as Trump once envisioned, preferring other types of border technology. Asked about Trump\\'s wall, Pelosi, who has said repeatedly she won\\'t approve money for it, said: \"Have I not been clear? No, I have been very clear.\"Within the White House, there was broad recognition among Trump\\'s aides that the shutdown pressure was growing, and they couldn\\'t keep the standoff going indefinitely. The president\\'s approval numbers had suffered during the impasse. Overnight and Friday, several Republicans were calling on him openly, and in private, to reopen the government.The breakthrough came as LaGuardia Airport in New York and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey both experienced at least 90-minute delays in takeoffs Friday because of the shutdown. And the world\\'s busiest airport \\x97 Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport \\x97 was experiencing long security wait times, a warning sign the week before it expects 150,000 out-of-town visitors for the Super Bowl.The standoff became so severe that, as the Senate opened with prayer, Chaplain Barry Black called on high powers in the \"hour of national turmoil\" to help senators do \"what is right.\"Senators were talking with increased urgency after Thursday\\'s defeat of competing proposals from Trump and the Democrats. Bipartisan talks provided a glimmer of hope Friday that some agreement could be reached. But several senators said they didn\\'t know what to expect as they arrived to watch the president\\'s televised address from their lunchroom off the Senate floor.The Senate first rejected a Republican plan Thursday reopening the government through September and giving Trump the $5.7 billion he\\'s demanded for building segments of that wall, a project that he\\'d long promised Mexico would finance. The 50-47 vote for the measure fell 10 shy of the 60 votes needed to succeed.Minutes later, senators voted 52-44 for a Democratic alternative that sought to open padlocked agencies through Feb. 8 with no wall money. That was eight votes short. But it earned more support than Trump\\'s plan, even though Republicans control the chamber 53-47. It was aimed at giving bargainers time to seek an accord while getting paychecks to government workers who are either working without pay or being forced to stay home.Contributing to the pressure on lawmakers to find a solution was the harsh reality confronting many of the federal workers, who on Friday faced a second two-week payday with no paychecks.Throughout, the two sides issued mutually exclusive demands that have blocked negotiations from even starting: Trump had refused to reopen government until Congress gave him the wall money, and congressional Democrats had rejected bargaining until he reopened government.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

The incident comes ahead of the peak Thanksgiving holiday travel season as travelers are still coping with the frustrations and concerns of safely traveling during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.It wasn\\x92t immediately known if the fleeing passenger was subsequently stopped or the firearm recovered. But airport operations were disrupted for at least two hours while an investigation continued. Neither passengers nor employees were in any danger, airport officials said.TSA referred all further questions to Atlanta police, who had no immediate update Saturday evening on the passenger\\x92s whereabouts.

But airport officials and the TSA said they decided to impose a temporary ground stop at the airport while Atlanta police investigated.Atlanta police gave the all-clear and normal operations resumed at the airport by 3:30 p.m. Subsequently TSA said all passengers in the airport were re-screened.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported social media users rushed from the airport in the chaos after hearing the noise of the gun going off.

But it\\x92s also a big jump from 2019, when 323 firearms were seized in Atlanta.Across the nation, the TSA said, it had stopped 4,495 airline passengers from carrying firearms onto their flights by Oct. 3 of this year, surpassing the previous record of 4,432 firearms caught at checkpoints in all of 2019.The agency announced the 2021 figures in a news release and noted the record comes despite a continued dip in passengers because of the pandemic. The release did not offer an explanation or theory about the spike in gun seizures.Hartsfield-Jackson is one of the nation\\x92s busiest airports, though other U.S. airports rival its passenger screening numbers. Dallas Forth Worth International Airport was second on the TSA\\x92s list, with 232 firearms seized by Oct. 3.\\xa0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

Coronavirus cases have been reported in all the 50 States in the US and District of Columbia as well as Puerto Rico. Globally, the death toll from the virus has risen to over 9,800 with more than 232,650 cases in 158 countries and territories.\"American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin or AAPI urges the federal, state and local governments and policy makers to advocate for more immediate and severe action to prevent the crisis from becoming unmanageable,\" said Suresh Reddy, AAPI president. Representing nearly 100,000 physicians of Indian-origin in the United States, AAPI is the largest ethnic medical association in the country.AAPI members are concerned over the growing COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on its society, healthcare system and economy, Reddy said. \"While applauding our fellow healthcare workers, including physicians, nurses, EMS, paramedics, medical assistants, and healthcare professionals, we are saddened that many of these heroes are being infected with COVID-19 while treating patients and often without personal protection equipment, endangering their safety and that of their families,\" Reddy said.\"We urge the authorities to provide the much needed equipment, testing and facilities enabling them to be isolated and treated, which will reduce our healthcare workforce at precisely the time we need them to be healthy and treating patients,\" he said.

For each diagnosed case, recent data shows that there are likely 10 undiagnosed carriers who can further infect the population, Einstein said.Sudhakar Jonnalagadda, president-Elect of AAPI, expressed great concern over the current rate of infections, saying it will have a materially adverse effect on both the senior populations and fellow physicians and healthcare workers who are on the front lines fighting the infection.\"It\\'s essential to create a wholesale expansion of free COVID-19 testing available in order for identifying asymptomatic carries and then isolating them,\" he said. Anupama Gotimukula, AAPI vice president warned that if the current trend continued without effective action: \"we would likely only see an effect on infection rates in 5-6 days, which means we could expect a tripling of infections and deaths in the interim.\"During the COVID-19 national emergency, which also constitutes a nationwide public health emergency, covered health care providers subject to the HIPAA rules may seek to communicate with patients, and provide telehealth services, through remote communications technologies.\"We appreciate regulations that remove HIPAA requirements for telemedicine to allow easier adaption and implementation,\" said Ravi Kolli, AAPI secretary.

As of 9 January, over 304 million confirmed COVD-19 cases and over 5.4 million deaths have been reported.The highest numbers of new cases were reported from the US (4,610,359 new cases; a 73 per cent increase), France (1,597,203 new cases; a 46 per cent increase), the UK (1,217,258 new cases; a 10 per cent increase), Italy (1,014,358 new cases; a 57 per cent increase) and India (638,872 new cases; a 524 per cent increase), the update said.Kerkhove said the 15 million cases reported in the last seven days are a \\x93record high in this pandemic\\x94 and are an \\x93underestimate\\x94 given the challenges in surveillance around the world and COVID-19 self-tests at home that are not registered.The WHO update said that the Omicron variant has a substantial growth advantage and is rapidly replacing other variants.\\x93This variant has been shown to have a shorter doubling time as compared to previous variants, with transmission occurring even amongst those vaccinated or with a history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection; there is increasing evidence that this variant is able to evade immunity,\\x94 the update said.It said that in terms of disease severity, there is growing evidence that the Omicron variant is less severe as compared to other variants.Citing a non-peer-reviewed retrospective cohort study from the US, the update said the findings suggest that while the absolute number of cases and hospitalisations among children are currently increasing in the US, the risk of hospitalisation still remains lower compared to other age groups during the period when Omicron is circulating as compared to the period when the Delta variant was dominant.The update also noted that since December, six studies have provided evidence of reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) of COVID-19 vaccines against the Omicron variant.\"While early VE estimates against the Omicron variant should be interpreted with caution due to potential biases, these preliminary results provide evidence of reduced overall effectiveness of vaccines against the Omicron variant, with greater declines in effectiveness with increasing time since vaccination, relative to Delta... While a booster vaccination appears to improve VE against infection and hospitalisation due to the Omicron variant, more data are needed to assess both the magnitude and duration of the protection,\\x94 the update said.The WHO Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-CO-VAC) said that as coronavirus evolves, the composition of current COVID-19 vaccines may need to be updated, to ensure that \\x93COVID-19 vaccines continue to provide WHO-recommended levels of protection against infection and disease by VOCs, including Omicron and future variants.\\x94Kerkhove added that as Omicron enters and circulates among vulnerable populations, \\x93we will see an increase in hospitalisations and deaths. So please treat this virus as seriously as it needs to be treated. The narrative that it\\'s the common cold is not true. The narrative that it is just mild is not true. So we have to really fight against it.

She was abducted while riding a rented vehicle and was held for several hours before being released. She was found near the F-9 Park area of the capital with torture marks on her body.Addressing a press conference along with Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and National Security Adviser (NSA) Moeed Yusuf, Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Qazi Jameelur Rehman said police had collected the video footage of all places visited by the envoy\\x92s daughter that included the collected data of around 300 CCTV cameras in Islamabad and Rawalpindi.\\x93We used all our resources for the investigation\\x85and supported all law enforcement agencies,\\x94 he said, adding that the abduction was not proven yet.Rehman said police had analysed all footage of the movement of the ambassador\\x92s daughter on the day of the kidnapping, however, the \\x93impression given (about her abduction) is not corroborated by the evidence we have collected\\x94, the Dawn newspaper reported.He said more than 220 people were interviewed and all footage analysed which showed her whereabouts. In a statement to police, Alikhil had said she went to buy a gift and hired a taxi. While coming back, the driver pulled over on the roadside after a five-minute drive and another man barged in who first shouted at her then started beating her. \\x93Because I was scared, so I felt unconscious,\\x94 she said.Alikhil said after she regained consciousness, she found herself \\x93at a place full of dirt\\x94. She then took a taxi to go to a nearby park from where she called her father\\x92s colleague, who brought her home.The kidnapping and assault incident has soured the ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan. On Sunday, the diplomatic crisis between the two nations deepened after Kabul announced that it will withdraw its ambassador and other senior staff from Islamabad.Pakistan also called back its ambassador to Afghanistan for \"consultations\" on the alleged abduction and release of the Afghan envoy\\x92s daughter.During the press conference, Foreign Minister Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to taking the investigation to its logical conclusion at the earliest. He said the security of the Afghan consulates and diplomatic staff in Pakistan have been beefed up.He said the Afghan authorities want to send their teams to check the \\x93security environment\\x94 and Islamabad has responded in affirmative to their request.He asked the Afghan government to review their decision of recalling their ambassador. \\x93We don\\x92t have any intention to hide anything...we need their cooperation to take the investigation to its logical conclusion,\\x94 Qureshi said.NSA Yusuf said Pakistan is in the middle of a targeted \"hybrid warfare\" and information war was being used against it. He said the incident of abduction was also being used to tarnish Pakistan by creating a narrative against it.He said the focus of all efforts was to create an impression that Pakistan was trying to destabilise Afghanistan and that the security situation in Pakistan was precarious.\"This is part of an orchestrated campaign of which various fronts have been opened against Pakistan,\" he said.Pakistan and Afghanistan often trade accusations, with Kabul claiming Islamabad is sending thousands of militants to fight in the war-torn country and providing safe haven for the Taliban.Pakistan, in turn, claims that Afghanistan harbours the anti-Pakistani group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan - the Pakistani Taliban - and also the secessionist Balochistan Liberation Army.Afghanistan has seen an uptick in violence after US President Joe Biden\\x92s announcement of the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from the war-torn country.\\xa0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

And they also agreed, importantly, that they will not recognise any government that is imposed through military force,\" State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters on Thursday.His remarks came as the Taliban advanced across Afghanistan and took control over key provincial capitals.Reports say that the militant group has captured Herat and Kandahar, the country\\x92s second and third largest cities after Kabul, and a strategic provincial capital on Thursday.It comes just weeks before the end of the American military mission in Afghanistan.The US Embassy in Afghanistan issued a security alert Thursday, urging Americans to \\x93leave Afghanistan immediately using available commercial flight options.\\x94\"So this is not just the United States making this point.

      "['Russia interfering with US Elections 2020, say US intelligence officials', 'Intelligence officials have warned lawmakers that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election campaign to help President Donald Trump get reelected, three officials familiar with the closed-door briefing said Thursday.', \"US President Donald Trump with Russian President Vladimir PutinIntelligence officials have warned lawmakers that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election campaign to help President Donald Trump get reelected, three officials familiar with the closed-door briefing said Thursday. The warning raises questions about the integrity of the presidential campaign and whether Trump's administration is taking the proper steps to combat the kind of interference that the U.S. saw in 2016.The officials asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. They said the briefing last week focused on Russia\\x92s efforts to influence the 2020 election and sow discord in the American electorate.The warning was first reported by The New York Times and The Washington Post.A senior administration officialsaid the news infuriated Trump, who complained that Democrats would use the information against him. Over the course of his presidency, Trump has dismissed the intelligence community\\x92s assessment of Russia\\x92s 2016 election interference as a conspiracy to undermine his victory.The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private meeting.One day after the Feb. 13 briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Trump berated the then-director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, and he announced this week that Maguire would be replaced by Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist.U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the 2016 election through social media campaigns and stealing and distributing emails from Democratic accounts. They say Russia was trying to boost Trump\\x92s campaign and add chaos to the American political process. Special counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russian interference was \\x93sweeping and systematic,\\x94 but he did not find a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.Republican lawmakers who were in last week's briefing by the DNI\\x92s chief election official, Shelby Pierson, pushed back by noting that Trump has been tough on Russia, one of the officials said.While Trump has imposed severe economic sanctions on Russia, he also has spoken warmly of Russian leader Vladimir Putin and withdrawn troops from areas, like Syria, where Moscow could fill the vacuum. He delayed military aid last year to Ukraine, a Russian adversary \\x97 a decision that was at the core of his impeachment proceedings.The Times said Trump was angry that the House briefing was made before the panel's chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, who led the impeachment proceedings.Trump on Thursday formally appointed Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, to replace Maguire as the new acting director of national intelligence. Maguire was required to step down soon under federal law governing acting appointments. The Times cited two administration officials as saying the timing, after the intelligence briefing, was coincidental.Grenell's background is primarily in politics and media affairs. He lacks the extensive national security and military experience of Maguire, as well as previous holders of the position overseeing the nation's 17 intelligence agencies.His appointment does little to heal the president\\x92s fraught relations with the intelligence community, which Trump has derided as part of a \\x93deep state\\x94 of entrenched bureaucrats that seek to undermine his agenda. The administration has most notably feuded with the intelligence community over the Russian interference and the events surrounding Trump's impeachment.Pierson told NPR in an interview that aired last month that the Russians \\x93are already engaging in influence operations relative to candidates going into 2020. But we do not have evidence at this time that our adversaries are directly looking at interfering with vote counts or the vote tallies.\\x94Pierson, appointed in July 2019 by then-Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, works with intelligence agencies like the CIA, the FBI, the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security to identify anyone seeking to interfere with U.S. elections.Pierson told NPR that the U.S. doesn\\x92t know exactly what the Russians are planning, but she said it\\x92s not just a Russia problem.\\x93We\\x92re still also concerned about China, Iran, non-state actors, hacktivists and frankly \\x97 certainly for DHS and FBI - even Americans that might be looking to undermine confidence in the elections.\\x94At an open hearing this month, FBI Director Christopher Wray told the House Judiciary Committee that Russia was engaged in \\x93information warfare\\x94 heading into the November election, but that law enforcement had not seen efforts to target America's infrastructure. He said Russia is relying on a covert social media campaign to divide the American public.Also Read | FACT CHECK: Is US President Donald Trump confused about Ahmedabad\\x92s total population?Also Read | US-Taliban Peace deal to be signed on Feb 29, says US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

From Israel, President Donald Trump\\x92s National Security Adviser John Bolton said Iran could walk through an \\x93open door\\x94 to talks with America, though he also warned that \\x93all options remain on the table\\x94 if Tehran makes good on its promise to begin breaking one limit from its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.While resembling the exchange of insults just before North Korea\\x92s leader and Trump sat down for talks, Iran so far appears to have no interest in negotiations\\x93The useless sanctioning of Islamic Revolution Supreme Leader (Khamenei) and the commander of Iranian diplomacy means closing the doors of diplomacy by the U.S.' desperate administration,\\x94 Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi tweeted. \\x93Trump\\x92s government is annihilating all the established international mechanisms for keeping peace and security in the world.\\x94The crisis gripping the Middle East stems from Trump\\x92s withdrawal of the U.S. a year ago from the nuclear deal with Iran and other world powers and then imposing crippling new sanctions on Tehran. Recently, Iran quadrupled its production of low-enriched uranium to be on pace to break one of the deal\\x92s terms by Thursday, while also threatening to raise enrichment closer to weapons-grade levels on July 7 if European countries still abiding by the accord don\\x92t offer a new deal.Citing unspecified Iranian threats, the U.S. has sent an aircraft carrier to the Middle East and deployed additional troops alongside the tens of thousands already there. All this has raised fears that a miscalculation or further rise in tensions could push the U.S. and Iran into an open conflict, 40 years after the Islamic Revolution.Trump enacted the new sanctions against Khamenei and his associates on Monday.That action followed Iran\\x92s downing on June 20 of a U.S. surveillance drone, worth over $100 million, above the Strait of Hormuz, sharply escalating the crisis. Trump then said he pulled back from the brink of retaliatory military strikes but continued his pressure campaign against Iran.U.S. officials also said they plan sanctions against Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, something that drew Rouhani\\x92s anger during his televised address Tuesday.\\x93You sanction the foreign minister simultaneously with a request for talks,\\x94 an exasperated Rouhani said, calling the sanctions \\x93outrageous and idiotic.\\x94\\x93The White House is afflicted by mental retardation and does not know what to do,\\x94 he added.There was no immediate reaction from Washington to the remarks. The sharp comments recalled North Korea\\x92s verbal attacks on Trump before the dramatic change in course and the start of negotiations with Washington. In 2017, state media quoted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un calling Trump \\x93the mentally deranged U.S. dotard.\\x94However, there are no signs the Iranian leadership would welcome talks.Mousavi\\x92s statement echoed that of Iran\\x92s U.N. ambassador, Majid Takht Ravanchi, who warned Monday that the situation in the Persian Gulf is \\x93very dangerous\\x94 and said any talks with the U.S. are impossible in the face of escalating sanctions and intimidation. Meanwhile, the U.S. envoy at the United Nations, Jonathan Cohen, said the Trump administration\\x92s aim is to get Tehran back to negotiations.The sanctions were announced as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held talks with officials in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia about building a broad, global coalition that includes Asian and European countries to counter Iran. Pompeo is likely to face a tough sell in Europe and Asia, particularly from those nations still committed to the nuclear deal with Iran.Meanwhile, Bolton said Trump was open to real negotiations to eliminate Iran\\x92s nuclear weapons program and \\x93all that Iran needs to do is walk through that open door.\\x94 He was meeting with his Russian and Israel counterparts in a first-of-its-kind trilateral security summit in Jerusalem that was focused on Iranian involvement in regional conflicts, particularly in neighboring Syria.\\x93As we speak, American diplomatic representatives are surging across the Middle East, seeking a path to peace. In response, Iran\\x92s silence has been deafening,\\x94 Bolton said. \\x93There is simply no evidence that Iran has made the strategic decision to renounce nuclear weapons and open realistic discussions to demonstrate that decision.\\x94But only hours later, Bolton told a news conference that \\x93all options remain on the table\\x94 if Iran goes over the limit for its low-enriched uranium stockpile as planned by Thursday.\\x93It would not be in their interest to do it but they have done a lot of things recently that are not in their interest,\\x94 Bolton said.\", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",
      "['Chinese COVID-19 vaccine BBIBP-CorV shows promise in human trial: Lancet study', 'A previous clinical trial reported similar results for a different vaccine that is also based on inactivated whole SARS-CoV-2 virus, but in that study the vaccine was only tested in people aged under 60 years.', 'Chinese COVID-19 vaccine BBIBP-CorV shows promise in human trial: Lancet studyOne of China\\'s leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates, called BBIBP-CorV, was shown to be safe and elicited immune response in a small early-phase human trial, researchers said on Friday.\\xa0A previous clinical trial reported similar results for a different vaccine that is also based on inactivated whole SARS-CoV-2 virus, but in that study the vaccine was only tested in people aged under 60 years.The latest study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, included participants aged between 18 and 80 years, and found that antibody responses were induced in all recipients. Participants aged 60 and over were slower to respond, taking 42 days before antibodies were detected in all recipients compared with 28 days for participants aged 18-59, the researchers said.Antibody levels were also lower in those aged 60-80 years compared with those aged 18-59, they said. The BBIBP-CorV vaccine used in the study is based on a sample of the virus that was isolated from a patient in China.Stocks of the virus were grown in the lab using cell lines and then inactivated using a chemical called beta-proprionolactone.BBIBP-CorV includes the killed virus mixed with another component, aluminium hydroxide, which is called an adjuvant because it is known to boost immune responses.The trial was not designed to assess efficacy of the vaccine, so it is not possible to say whether the antibody responses induced by the vaccine, called BBIBP-CorV, are sufficient to protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection, according to the researchers.\"Protecting older people is a key aim of a successful COVID-19 vaccine as this age group is at greater risk of severe illness from the disease,\" said Professor Xiaoming Yang, one of the authors of the study, from the Beijing Institute of Biological Products Company Limited.\"However, vaccines are sometimes less effective in this group because the immune system weakens with age. It is therefore encouraging to see that BBIBP-CorV induces antibody responses in people aged 60 and older, and we believe this justifies further investigation,\" said Yang.There are currently 42 vaccines for COVID-19 in clinical trials, the researchers noted.\\xa0These vary in type and include DNA plasmid vaccines, inactivated virus vaccines, adenovirus-vectored vaccines, RNA vaccines, protein subunit vaccines and virus-like particle vaccines, they said.Some of these have already been shown to be safe and to elicit immune responses in early phase clinical trials. The first phase of the study involved 96 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 59 years and a second group of 96 participants aged between 60 years and 80 years.\\xa0Within each group, the vaccine was tested at three different dose levels, with two vaccinations administered on day 0 and 28.A fourth group within each age group were given two doses of a placebo vaccine. In the second phase of the study, 448 participants aged between 18 and 59 years were randomly assigned to receive either one 8 microgramme shot of vaccine or placebo, or two shots of 4 microgramme vaccine or placebo.No serious adverse events were reported within 28 days of the final vaccination, and the most common side effect was pain at the injection site, the researchers said. There were no instances of clinically significant changes in organ functions detected in laboratory tests in any of the groups, they said.The greatest antibody responses were elicited by two 4 microgramme doses of the vaccine at either days 0 and 21 or 0 and 28, according to the resaerchers.\"Our findings indicate that a booster shot is necessary to achieve the greatest antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 and could be important for protection. This provides useful information for a phase 3 trial,\\x94 Yang said.The researchers noted some limitations with the study, including the short duration of follow up at just 42 days. They also highlighted that the study did not include children and adolescents aged under 18.\"More studies are needed to establish whether the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are capable of inducing and maintaining virus-specific T-cell responses,\" said Professor Larisa Rudenko from the Institute of Experimental Medicine, Russia, who was not involved in the study.This is because CD4-positive T-cell help is important for optimal antibody responses, as well as for cytotoxic CD8-positive T-cell activation, which, in turn, are crucial for viral clearance if neutralising antibody-mediated protection is incomplete, Rudenko said.\\xa0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n",

      "Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the \"forgotten floor,\" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \"forgotten floor.\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \"avoidable felonies.\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. \"I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!\" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered \"lunatics\" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the \"forgotten floor\"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served. E-mail to a friend . See\n"

Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the \"forgotten floor,\" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \"forgotten floor.\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \"avoidable felonies.\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' » . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. \"I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!\" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered \"lunatics\" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment.
